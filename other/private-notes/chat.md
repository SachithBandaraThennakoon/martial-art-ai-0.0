> The research-worthy core is now clear: a hybrid architecture where learned temporal predictions provide evidence, but deterministic biomechanical and ordered-state rules remain authoritative. That distinction is important for the thesis because it improves explainability and avoids claiming that the neural model alone performs repetition counting. I’m checking the test suite and separating implemented features from experimental or future-facing features so the report stays academically honest.

I now understand the upgraded system well enough to help prepare an accurate research report/thesis. The active project is [martial-art-ai](</C:/Users/DELL/OneDrive - Vantage Ltd/Documents/New project/martial-art-ai>); the other folders appear to be older versions or backups.

### System overview

The project is an intelligent web-based martial-arts training platform that uses computer vision, biomechanical rules, temporal movement recognition, and personalised coaching.

The main processing flow is:

1. Capture the user’s movement through a webcam or uploaded video.
2. MediaPipe extracts 33 body landmarks, with optional hand and facial landmarks.
3. Landmarks are normalised using hip position and torso scale.
4. Joint angles, velocity, acceleration, visibility, symmetry, and movement energy are calculated.
5. Technique-specific rules evaluate posture and form.
6. A temporal model predicts movement phases across a 90-frame sequence.
7. An ordered state machine validates the complete movement sequence.
8. Valid repetitions, incomplete movements, tracking loss, and form errors are identified.
9. The system produces text/voice feedback and stores session analytics.

### Core architecture

The system has four intelligence levels:

- Level 1 – Motion layer: landmark smoothing, normalisation, velocity, acceleration, and short-term motion prediction.
- Level 2 – Action layer: technique-step identification, biomechanical accuracy, segmentation, and optional ONNX predictions.
- Level 3 – Session layer: repetition quality, repeated mistakes, fatigue risk, performance trends, and recommendations.
- Level 4 – User layer: long-term progress, weaknesses, technique mastery, and personalised recommendations.

It also contains three main student modes:

- Train Mode: causal, real-time step-by-step instruction and immediate corrections.
- Practice Mode: independent repetitions, recording, repetition detection, scoring, and post-session correction.
- Analysis Mode: history, performance summaries, repetitions, errors, timelines, and progress.

Administrative tools support uploaded-video testing, temporal-data recording, manual annotation, skeleton manipulation, and model evaluation.

### Research contribution

The strongest research contribution is the hybrid recognition architecture:

- A technique-conditioned ST-GCN/TCN model generates temporal phase probabilities.
- A deterministic state machine enforces valid phase order and minimum durations.
- A Viterbi-style offline decoder repairs short gaps and rejects impossible transitions.
- Biomechanical rules calculate explainable form scores and corrections.
- Count cues are used only for reaction-time analysis—they cannot create repetitions.

This is more defensible than presenting the project as a purely neural-network system because it combines learned recognition with explainability and safety constraints.

A suitable thesis title would be:

> Design and Evaluation of a Hybrid Computer-Vision and Temporal-Learning System for Real-Time Martial Arts Movement Assessment and Personalised Coaching

### Implemented scope

The content library contains 33 enabled techniques across martial arts, fitness, yoga, mobility, meditation, and self-defence. However, the complete temporal/learned recognition pipeline currently focuses on:

- Jab
- Front kick

The shared ONNX model uses:

- 33 MediaPipe joints
- x, y, z and visibility channels
- 90-frame sequences
- hip-centred, torso-scale normalisation
- canonical movement phases such as preparation, execution, peak, retraction and recovery

### Technology stack

- Frontend: React 19, Vite and React Router
- Computer vision: MediaPipe Tasks Vision
- Browser inference: ONNX Runtime Web
- Backend: FastAPI and Python
- Database: SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL-compatible configuration
- Security: JWT authentication, bcrypt password hashing and role protection
- Deployment design: Azure Static Web Apps, Azure App Service and Docker
- Other features: subscriptions, dashboard, password reset, contact system, voice coaching and body calibration

### Current verification

The implementation currently passes:

- 126 frontend tests
- 23 backend tests
- 149 tests in total

These cover temporal decoding, biomechanical features, form scoring, noise rejection, tracking loss, repetition boundaries, technique packages, coaching conversations, analytics, security, and session handling.

### Important thesis limitation

The deployed universal-model metadata reports:

- Validation macro F1: approximately 0.744
- Test macro F1: approximately 0.472

Therefore, the thesis should describe the learned model as an experimental prototype—not as a fully validated production classifier. The strongest final evaluation should include human participant data, participant-independent testing, repetition precision/recall, false repetitions per minute, boundary error, latency, usability, and comparison against the rule-only baseline.

I can next produce the complete thesis structure, including the abstract, introduction, research problem, objectives, literature review, methodology, architecture diagrams, implementation, evaluation plan, results, limitations, conclusion, and references. Send me your university thesis template or required chapter format, if one exists.

> so what best topic for that

The best research topic for your current system is:

> **Design and Evaluation of an Explainable Hybrid Computer Vision System for Real-Time Martial Arts Technique Assessment**

This is the strongest choice because it focuses on the genuinely implemented research core:

- MediaPipe pose estimation
- Biomechanical joint-angle analysis
- ST-GCN/TCN temporal phase recognition
- Ordered state-machine validation
- Repetition detection
- Explainable form corrections
- Real-time feedback

It also gives you a clear comparison for evaluation:

> **Hybrid model vs. rule-based model vs. learned temporal model**

### Recommended research question

> How effectively can a hybrid system combining pose estimation, biomechanical rules, and temporal learning recognise martial arts movements and provide explainable real-time technique feedback?

### Main research objectives

1. Develop a webcam-based system for extracting martial-arts movements using MediaPipe.
2. Design biomechanical rules for evaluating joint angles and form.
3. develop a temporal model for recognising movement phases.
4. Combine learned predictions with an ordered state machine.
5. Evaluate repetition detection, movement classification, feedback accuracy, and system latency.
6. Compare the hybrid approach with a rule-only baseline.

### Recommended scope

For the research evaluation, focus primarily on:

- Jab
- Front kick

These are the two techniques with complete temporal-model support. The other techniques can be presented as an extensible training library, but they should not all be included in the main experiment.

### Alternative title with stronger AI emphasis

> **Hybrid Pose Estimation and Temporal Deep Learning for Explainable Martial Arts Movement Recognition and Form Assessment**

My recommendation is the first title because it is clear, academically defensible, and broad enough to cover the full system without overclaiming the current model’s accuracy.

> combat cognition framwork?? is this good?

**“Combat Cognition Framework”** is a strong and memorable framework name, but by itself it is too vague for an academic research topic. It does not explain the computer-vision, temporal-learning, or movement-assessment contribution.

The best approach is to use it as the framework name inside a descriptive thesis title:

> **Combat Cognition: An Explainable Hybrid Framework for Real-Time Martial Arts Movement Recognition and Technique Assessment**

This fits your system because “cognition” can represent its four intelligence layers:

1. **Motion cognition** — landmarks, angles, velocity and prediction
2. **Action cognition** — movement phases and technique recognition
3. **Session cognition** — repetitions, mistakes, consistency and fatigue
4. **User cognition** — progress, weaknesses and personalised coaching

A suitable research question is:

> How effectively can the Combat Cognition Framework combine pose estimation, temporal deep learning and biomechanical rules to recognise martial arts movements and generate explainable real-time feedback?

One caution: “combat” may sound like opponent detection, tactical decision-making, or fight analysis. Your current system primarily evaluates individual technique performance. Therefore, define the term clearly in the thesis.

My final recommended title is:

> **Combat Cognition: Design and Evaluation of an Explainable Hybrid Framework for Real-Time Martial Arts Technique Assessment**

That is distinctive, technically accurate, and suitable for a thesis.

> </details>
</details>

You have achieved the **architecture of a Combat Cognition Framework**, but not yet a complete “real martial artist simulation.”

The accurate research claim is:

> The system is a cognitive martial-arts coaching prototype that implements a perception–awareness–decision–feedback loop.

### What you already achieved

| Cognitive stage | Current implementation | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Perception | MediaPipe pose, hand and face landmarks | Achieved |
| Motion understanding | Angles, velocity, acceleration, tracking confidence | Achieved |
| Action understanding | Technique states, movement phases and repetition boundaries | Achieved for Jab and Front Kick |
| Situation awareness | Mistakes, fatigue risk, attention target, progression and tracking state | Achieved |
| Decision-making | Coaching state machine, priorities and next-action selection | Achieved |
| Communication | Voice and text corrections | Achieved |
| Memory | Sessions, weaknesses, performance trends and user profile | Partially achieved |
| LLM brain | Generative reasoning using an actual LLM | **Not implemented** |
| Tactical combat reasoning | Opponent, distance, threats and attack/defence decisions | **Not implemented** |
| Continuous learning | Automatically improving from each user session | **Not fully implemented** |

### Important finding

Your backend components are named “agents,” but they are currently deterministic Python logic, rules and state machines. I found no OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Ollama or other LLM integration.

Therefore, this pipeline exists:

```text
Perception → Motion/Action Intelligence → Situation Awareness
           → Rule-Based Coaching Brain → Voice/Text Feedback → Memory
```

But your intended pipeline is not complete yet:

```text
Perception → Awareness → Grounded LLM Brain
           → Safe Decision Controller → Feedback/Action → Long-Term Memory
```

The good part is that your system already creates a structured `coach_intelligence_context` packet containing all four temporal layers and situation awareness. This is exactly the type of grounded information that should be passed to an LLM. The LLM should receive this structured context—not raw camera frames.

### Is it a real martial artist simulation?

Not in the full sense. A real martial-artist simulation would also require:

- Opponent detection and tracking
- Combat distance and orientation
- Threat and attack recognition
- Defence and counterattack selection
- Multi-step tactical planning
- Reaction under changing situations
- An action policy or animated/robotic body
- Learning from previous combat encounters

Your present system simulates the cognition of an **intelligent martial-arts coach observing a student**, rather than a martial artist fighting an opponent.

### Best academic positioning

Use this claim:

> **Combat Cognition is a perception–awareness–decision framework that simulates an intelligent martial-arts coach through hybrid computer vision, temporal movement understanding, explainable rules and personalised feedback.**

Avoid claiming:

> “The system completely simulates a real martial artist.”

Your best thesis title remains:

> **Combat Cognition: Design and Evaluation of a Perception–Awareness–Decision Framework for Intelligent Martial Arts Coaching**

If you later integrate a grounded LLM decision layer, the title could become:

> **Combat Cognition: A Grounded Multimodal Cognitive Architecture for Perception, Situation Awareness and Intelligent Martial Arts Coaching**

So the honest conclusion is: **you have achieved the foundation and most of the perception-awareness framework, but the genuine LLM brain and tactical martial-artist simulation remain future development.**

> ok so i think i achived lot of simulates a real martial artist thins so this core is Combat Cognition framwork so i mostly achive that??

Yes—you have mostly achieved the **core Combat Cognition Framework**, provided you define it as a system that reproduces selected cognitive functions of a martial artist or coach, not as a complete virtual fighter.

Your system already follows this cognitive loop:

```text
Perception
Camera → body, hand and face landmarks

Understanding
Angles → motion → action phases → repetitions

Awareness
Technique state → mistakes → fatigue → weaknesses → progression

Decision
Attention selection → correction → continue/repeat/advance

Response
Visual guidance → text feedback → voice coaching

Memory
Sessions → performance trends → user-level adaptation
```

### What is substantially achieved

- Human-body perception
- Biomechanical understanding
- Temporal movement understanding
- Technique-state recognition
- Situation and performance awareness
- Attention prioritisation
- Explainable coaching decisions
- Voice and visual responses
- Session and user memory
- Limited movement prediction
- Personalised progression

These components are enough to present **Combat Cognition as the principal framework and original contribution of the project**.

### What remains outside the completed core

- A genuine LLM reasoning layer
- Opponent and threat perception
- Tactical fighting decisions
- Defence/counterattack planning
- Physical or animated execution
- Automatic continual model learning

These do not invalidate your framework. They define its present boundary and future work.

### Correct thesis claim

Use language such as:

> This research introduces Combat Cognition, a hybrid cognitive framework that simulates selected perception, movement-understanding, situation-awareness, decision-making and memory functions associated with martial-arts coaching.

You can also state:

> The framework does not attempt to simulate the complete physical and tactical intelligence of a human martial artist. Instead, it focuses on the cognitive processes required to observe, interpret and evaluate individual martial-arts performance.

### Final assessment

You have:

- **Mostly achieved the core cognitive framework**
- **Achieved a functional martial-arts coaching simulation**
- **Partially achieved broader martial-artist cognition**
- **Not yet achieved a complete embodied or tactical martial-artist simulation**

Therefore, **Combat Cognition Framework** is an appropriate and defensible name. The best title is:

> **Combat Cognition: Design and Evaluation of a Hybrid Perception–Awareness–Decision Framework for Intelligent Martial Arts Coaching**

> so we can write report that main objective is completely simulates a real martial artist so now we develop/achive the core is Combat Cognition .correct??

Almost correct—but the report should not claim that the current system **completely simulates a real martial artist**. That would be difficult to defend because opponent reasoning, tactical planning, embodied action, and a genuine LLM brain are not yet implemented.

Use this distinction:

### Long-term vision

> To develop an intelligent system capable of progressively simulating the perceptual, cognitive, tactical and adaptive capabilities of a real martial artist.

### Main objective of this research

> To design, implement and evaluate the Combat Cognition Framework as the core cognitive architecture for perceiving human movement, developing situation awareness, assessing martial-arts techniques, making coaching decisions and providing personalised feedback.

### Current achievement

> This research achieves the core Combat Cognition Framework, representing the first stage toward a more complete simulation of martial-artist cognition.

The relationship is:

```text
Long-term goal: Complete martial-artist simulation
                         ↓
Current research contribution: Combat Cognition Framework
                         ↓
Implemented capabilities:
Perception → movement understanding → awareness
→ coaching decisions → feedback → memory
```

A strong report statement would be:

> The ultimate goal of the project is to simulate the cognitive capabilities of a real martial artist. This research does not claim to achieve a complete human-level simulation. Instead, it develops and evaluates Combat Cognition, the foundational framework that integrates perception, temporal movement understanding, situation awareness, explainable decision-making and personalised coaching.

Therefore:

- **Complete martial-artist simulation** = overarching vision
- **Combat Cognition Framework** = main contribution achieved in this research
- **Future development** = LLM reasoning, opponents, tactics, planning and embodied action

This positioning is ambitious but academically honest and much easier to defend during your thesis presentation.

Understood. I reviewed both PDFs, and I will **not generate the report until we finish discussing and agreeing on its content**.

The DS5299 report requires:

1. Front page based on the M.Sc. specimen title page
2. Table of contents
3. Chapter 1 – Introduction
   - Problem justification
   - Objectives
4. Chapter 2 – Literature Review
5. Chapter 3 – Methodology
6. Chapter 4 – Results and Discussion
7. Conclusions and Recommendations
8. References
9. Appendices, if required
10. Final submission as a PDF

### Formatting requirements

- A4 white paper
- Times New Roman
- Main text: 12 pt
- Line spacing: 1.5
- Left margin: 40 mm
- Right margin: 15 mm
- Top and bottom margins: 25 mm
- Main chapters numbered using Arabic page numbers
- Preliminary pages use lowercase Roman numerals
- Chapter number and title: uppercase, bold, centred, 14 pt
- Figure captions: below the figure, 10 pt
- Table titles: above the table, 10 pt
- References: either Author–Year or Numeric style, used consistently
- Abstract limit in the general guideline: 350 words, single paragraph

### Points we must clarify before writing

There are two ambiguities in the supplied instructions:

- The DS5299 sheet says “Chapter 6 – Conclusions & Recommendations” immediately after Chapter 4. This is probably a numbering error, but we should not assume whether a Chapter 5 is expected.
- The general guideline includes declaration, abstract, acknowledgements, lists of figures/tables and abbreviations. The shorter DS5299-specific list does not explicitly request all of these. We should confirm which preliminary pages your lecturer expects.

### What we should discuss first

Before drafting, we should agree on:

1. Final project title
2. Exact definition of the Combat Cognition Framework
3. Research problem and motivation
4. Main objective and specific objectives
5. Research questions
6. Scope and boundaries
7. Architecture and implemented components
8. What counts as the original contribution
9. Experimental methodology
10. Datasets and participants
11. Evaluation metrics and baselines
12. Results that are currently available
13. Limitations and future work
14. Claims we can defend during the presentation
15. Literature-review themes

The first decision should be the research position:

> **Combat Cognition is the achieved core framework, while complete simulation of a real martial artist is the project’s long-term vision.**

No report file or report content has been generated.

> so we use 2 models in level 2 and 3 so is this model need Evaluation/testing result/accuracy...??and system need Evaluation/testing result/accuracy...?? so how we do??

<details><summary>2 previous messages</summary>

> Yes—your thesis needs two separate evaluation layers: evaluation of each learned model and evaluation of the complete Combat Cognition system. I’ll map this to the models actually present in the code so we do not accidentally report a rule-based intelligence layer as a trained ML model.

</details>

Yes, both the AI components and the complete system need evaluation—but they require different tests.

First, one important correction from the implementation:

- **ACP-STGAT** and the **universal temporal phase model** are both learned models contributing mainly to motion/action intelligence.
- **Level 3 is currently not a trained ML model.** It is a deterministic session-intelligence algorithm that calculates mastery, consistency, repeated mistakes, trends, fatigue risk and recommendations.

That is acceptable, but the thesis architecture must describe it accurately.

## 1. Model-level evaluation

### Model A: ACP-STGAT motion predictor

Purpose: use 60 past frames to predict the next 30 frames of 33 body joints.

Evaluate using:

- Normalised joint-position MAE or RMSE
- Mean Per-Joint Position Error
- Prediction error at different future horizons
- Velocity and acceleration error
- Performance during brief tracking loss
- Inference time and frames per second

Compare it with simple baselines:

- Last-pose baseline
- Linear-velocity prediction
- ACP-STGAT prediction

Because MediaPipe coordinates are not automatically real-world millimetres, report normalised-coordinate error unless proper spatial calibration is performed.

### Model B: temporal phase classifier

Purpose: classify phases such as preparation, execution, peak, retraction and recovery.

Evaluate using:

- Precision, recall and F1 for every phase
- Macro F1
- Confusion matrix
- Technique-specific results for Jab and Front Kick
- Repetition precision, recall and F1
- False repetitions per minute
- Movement-boundary timing error
- Performance under tracking loss and unrelated movement

The current metadata contains:

- Validation macro F1: **0.744**
- Test macro F1: **0.472**

This test result is currently too weak to claim strong generalisation. It can be reported as an initial prototype result, followed by improvements or an explanation of dataset limitations.

## 2. Level 3 evaluation

Level 3 should be evaluated as a **decision algorithm**, not as an ML classifier.

Its outputs should be compared with expert-labelled sessions:

| Level 3 output | Evaluation |
|---|---|
| Repetition count | Count error and exact-count accuracy |
| Repeated mistake | Precision, recall and F1 |
| Mastery score | Correlation and MAE against expert scores |
| Consistency score | Correlation with expert/session variation |
| Recommendation | Agreement with expert recommendation |
| Fatigue risk | Sensitivity and specificity against observed form deterioration |
| Session summary | Correctness against manually labelled ground truth |

“Fatigue risk” must be handled carefully. Camera movement alone cannot prove physiological fatigue. A safer research term is:

> **Movement-quality deterioration risk**

If you want to call it fatigue, collect participant Rate of Perceived Exertion scores or expert fatigue observations.

## 3. Complete-system evaluation

The full Combat Cognition Framework must be tested end to end.

### Technical effectiveness

Measure:

- Repetition-counting accuracy
- Technique-phase recognition
- Form-error detection
- Feedback correctness
- Missed and false corrections
- Tracking success rate
- End-to-end response latency
- Browser frame rate
- Performance under different camera conditions

### Comparison experiment

The strongest evaluation would compare three configurations:

1. **Rule-only system**
2. **Learned-model-only system**
3. **Hybrid Combat Cognition system**

This directly tests your principal research claim:

> Does combining learned temporal evidence with deterministic biomechanical and sequence rules perform better than either approach individually?

### User evaluation

Participants can evaluate:

- Ease of use
- Feedback clarity
- Feedback usefulness
- Perceived responsiveness
- Trust in corrections
- Overall usability

A standard System Usability Scale questionnaire can be used, together with project-specific Likert-scale questions.

## 4. Ground-truth dataset

Record participants performing:

- Correct Jab repetitions
- Incorrect Jab repetitions
- Correct Front Kicks
- Incorrect Front Kicks
- Slow and fast executions
- Incomplete movements
- Unrelated movements
- Brief tracking loss
- Different body sizes and experience levels
- Different camera distances and angles

A qualified martial-arts instructor should label:

- Movement type
- Phase boundaries
- Completed repetitions
- Technique errors
- Form-quality score
- Appropriate coaching recommendation

If possible, use two evaluators and calculate inter-rater agreement.

## 5. Correct dataset splitting

Never randomly divide individual frames into training and testing sets. Frames from the same person or recording are highly similar and would produce misleadingly high results.

Use:

- Training participants
- Validation participants
- Completely unseen test participants

At minimum, split by recording session. A stronger evaluation splits by participant.

## 6. Recommended experimental scope

For a manageable independent-study project:

- Evaluate only Jab and Front Kick
- Include multiple participants
- Record multiple correct, incorrect and incomplete repetitions per participant
- Keep a separate unseen-participant test set
- Compare rule-only and hybrid configurations
- Obtain expert labels
- Measure accuracy, latency and usability

## What current tests prove

Your 149 passing automated tests demonstrate that the software logic behaves according to designed scenarios. They are valuable for implementation verification, but they do **not** prove real-world movement-recognition accuracy.

You therefore need three categories of evidence:

```text
Automated tests → Is the software implemented correctly?

Model evaluation → Do the learned models predict accurately?

System evaluation → Does Combat Cognition work effectively for real users?
```

This gives us a defensible methodology:

> **Model-level evaluation + algorithm-level evaluation + end-to-end system evaluation + user evaluation**

We should decide the available participants, martial-arts expert access, existing training dataset and remaining project time before fixing the final experiment design.

> when we start discussion .also what u needed for report like colab outputs,links,system outputs,... say what u want i can provied .start step by step

We can start the discussion now, one decision at a time. I will not write the report until we have agreed on the complete research story, evidence, experiments, and chapter plan.

# Step 1: Establish the research identity

My recommended current definition is:

### Proposed title

> **Combat Cognition: Design and Evaluation of a Hybrid Perception–Awareness–Decision Framework for Intelligent Martial Arts Coaching**

### Long-term vision

> To progressively simulate the perceptual, cognitive, tactical and adaptive capabilities of a real martial artist.

### Current research objective

> To design, implement and evaluate the Combat Cognition Framework for perceiving human movement, understanding martial-arts actions, developing situation awareness, making explainable coaching decisions and producing personalised feedback.

### Current principal contribution

> A hybrid cognitive architecture integrating MediaPipe perception, biomechanical rules, temporal deep-learning models, ordered movement validation, session intelligence, user memory and multimodal coaching feedback.

### Recommended experimental scope

- Primary technique: Jab
- Secondary technique: Front Kick
- Other 31 techniques: demonstrate framework extensibility, but do not claim complete learned-model validation for them

### Research boundary

> The project implements the core cognition required for intelligent martial-arts observation and coaching. Complete opponent-aware, tactical and embodied martial-artist simulation remains future work.

For Step 1, please tell me:

1. Is there already an officially approved project title?
2. Do you accept the proposed title above, or what wording would you change?
3. Is the final system intended mainly as an **AI martial-arts coach**, a **martial-artist cognitive simulation**, or both?
4. Is evaluating Jab and Front Kick acceptable, or must another technique be included?

After we settle these four points, we will move to **Step 2: research problem, justification and research gap**.

> 1. yes
> 2. no changes
> 3. martial-artist cognitive simulation
> 4. only jab .exceed other tech in future

Good. We will use **Jab as the only implemented and evaluated case study**. Other techniques will be described as future extensions of the general Combat Cognition Framework.

One item still needs exact confirmation: please provide the officially approved title exactly as written. If it is already the proposed title, simply confirm that.

## Agreed research position

### System identity

> A martial-artist cognitive simulation framework, demonstrated and evaluated through the Jab technique.

### Current contribution

> Combat Cognition simulates selected cognitive functions involved in perceiving, understanding and assessing martial-arts movement.

### Scope

- Jab: implementation and evaluation
- Other techniques: future work
- Opponent awareness and tactical combat: future work
- Complete human-level martial-artist simulation: long-term vision

This narrower scope will make the research stronger because we can examine one technique thoroughly instead of presenting weak results across many techniques.

# Step 2: Research problem and gap

## Proposed problem statement

> Learning and assessing martial-arts techniques normally requires continuous observation by an experienced instructor. Conventional computer-vision training systems often analyse isolated body poses or individual joint angles without understanding the temporal progression, intent and wider context of a movement. Consequently, they may incorrectly recognise incomplete movements, count repetitions from temporary poses, provide feedback without considering previous performance, and fail to develop session-level awareness. A cognitive framework is therefore required to connect perception, temporal movement understanding, situation awareness, decision-making and memory when assessing a martial-arts technique.

## Proposed research gap

The potential research gap has five parts:

1. **Frame-level perception without temporal understanding**
   Many pose-assessment systems evaluate individual frames but do not understand the complete movement sequence.

2. **Recognition without situation awareness**
   A system may identify a pose without understanding whether the user is preparing, executing, recovering, making a repeated error, losing tracking or experiencing declining performance.

3. **Black-box predictions without explainable verification**
   Learned models can produce movement predictions, but their outputs may not explain which joint or biomechanical condition is incorrect.

4. **No connection between short-term movement and long-term performance**
   Motion, action, repetition, session and user history are often processed separately instead of forming one cognitive hierarchy.

5. **Limited simulation of martial-arts cognition**
   Existing systems frequently behave as pose classifiers or repetition counters rather than cognitive systems that perceive, interpret, prioritise, decide, respond and remember.

We will later verify every literature-based gap with academic sources. Until then, these remain proposed research-gap statements rather than proven claims.

## Proposed justification

> The Combat Cognition Framework addresses this problem through a multi-level cognitive architecture. It converts visual observations into motion information, identifies Jab phases, validates the ordered movement, detects biomechanical errors, develops session-level awareness, selects an appropriate response and retains performance information. The Jab provides a controlled case study because it contains identifiable preparation, extension, peak, retraction and recovery phases while still presenting challenges involving speed, body orientation, incomplete execution and tracking noise.

## Proposed main research question

> How can a hybrid perception–awareness–decision framework simulate selected cognitive functions of a martial artist when interpreting and assessing the Jab technique?

## Proposed secondary questions

1. How accurately can the system recognise the temporal phases and completed repetitions of a Jab?
2. Does combining temporal learning with biomechanical and ordered-state rules improve performance over a rule-only approach?
3. Can the framework identify form errors and generate decisions that agree with expert assessment?
4. Can the complete framework operate with sufficient speed for real-time interaction?
5. How effectively can session history support awareness of repeated mistakes, consistency and movement-quality deterioration?

## Important architecture decision

Your current code does not contain a genuine LLM integration. Its “brain” is currently a deterministic situation-awareness and coaching decision controller.

Before we finalise the problem and objectives, I need two exact answers:

1. What is the officially approved title?
2. Will you implement an actual LLM brain before the final submission, or should the current rule-based cognitive decision layer be evaluated as the completed brain for this research?

> Jab technique is use for only Evaluation/testing result/accuracy.... model /system/framework i thin it good to be use martial art technique
>
> can u provied ur q with recommendation answers

That is the correct approach:

> **Combat Cognition is a general martial-arts cognitive framework. The Jab is only the experimental case study used to train models and evaluate model, system and framework performance.**

The framework should not be called a “Jab framework.” Its architecture is designed to support additional martial-arts techniques in future work.

## Recommended answers to my questions

### Question 1: What should the final title be?

Recommended answer:

> **Combat Cognition: Design and Evaluation of a Hybrid Perception–Awareness–Decision Framework toward Martial-Artist Cognitive Simulation**

I recommend **“toward”** because this research implements the cognitive foundation without claiming complete human-level simulation.

If your officially approved title is different, send its exact wording because the university title page must use the approved version.

### Question 2: Should an LLM be implemented before submission?

Recommended answer:

> The current research will evaluate the deterministic hybrid decision layer as the cognitive brain of Combat Cognition. An LLM-based reasoning layer will be proposed as future work.

I do not recommend adding an LLM only to strengthen the title. A rushed LLM integration would require additional:

- Grounding and prompt design
- Output validation
- Hallucination testing
- Decision-agreement evaluation
- Safety controls
- Latency and cost evaluation
- Comparison against the deterministic controller

Your current rule-based brain is explainable, testable and suitable for an academic prototype. The term “cognitive brain” does not require it to be an LLM.

## Recommended scope statement

> Combat Cognition is designed as a technique-extensible martial-arts cognitive framework. The Jab is selected as the initial experimental case study for model training and evaluation because it contains distinguishable preparation, execution, peak, retraction and recovery phases. Other martial-arts techniques are outside the present evaluation scope and are proposed as future extensions.

## Recommended framework claim

> The framework simulates selected cognitive functions associated with martial-arts movement understanding, including perception, motion prediction, action recognition, temporal awareness, biomechanical assessment, decision-making, feedback and memory.

## Recommended role of the Jab

The Jab will be used to evaluate three levels:

1. **Model evaluation**
   - Motion prediction
   - Temporal phase recognition

2. **System evaluation**
   - Repetition counting
   - Form-error detection
   - Feedback correctness
   - Latency and frame rate

3. **Framework evaluation**
   - Perception-to-decision flow
   - Situation awareness
   - Session understanding
   - Expert agreement
   - Rule-only versus hybrid performance

Therefore, the final positioning is:

```text
Combat Cognition Framework
            │
            ├── General martial-arts cognitive architecture
            │
            └── Jab experimental case study
                    ├── Model testing
                    ├── System testing
                    └── Framework evaluation
```

## Recommended Step 2 decisions

You can adopt these answers:

- General research domain: Martial-artist cognitive simulation
- Core contribution: Combat Cognition Framework
- Evaluation technique: Jab only
- Other techniques: Future extensions
- Current brain: Explainable deterministic hybrid decision layer
- LLM brain: Future enhancement
- Complete martial-artist simulation: Long-term goal
- Current achievement: Foundational cognitive simulation framework

If you accept these recommendations, Step 2 is settled. The next discussion will be **Step 3: defining the main objective, specific objectives and measurable success criteria**.

> 1. ok
> 2.  we use openai llm so we can replace that with own llm in future
>
> (also i need include full architecture to report like data pipline is core i think including perception , temporal resoning 2 layes, situation awarness, llm(open ai use now),.... )
>
> if step 2 ok for u ??

Yes, Step 2 is acceptable with one important verification: the OpenAI LLM must be documented as an implemented component only if we can show its actual integration and outputs.

The recommended position is:

> Combat Cognition currently uses an OpenAI LLM as its high-level reasoning and communication component. The architecture is designed so this external model can later be replaced by a privately trained or domain-specific martial-arts language model.

Do not send me any OpenAI API key.

## Full architecture in the report

Yes, the complete architecture and data pipeline should be central to the report. They are likely your strongest original contribution.

The proposed real-time pipeline is:

```text
Camera/Input Video
        ↓
Perception Layer
MediaPipe pose, hands and face
        ↓
Level 1: Motion Intelligence
Normalisation, angles, velocity, acceleration,
tracking confidence and short-term prediction
        ↓
Level 2: Action Intelligence
ACP-STGAT prediction, temporal phase classification,
biomechanical rules and ordered-state validation
        ↓
Level 3: Session Intelligence
Repetitions, consistency, repeated mistakes,
performance trend and movement-quality deterioration
        ↓
Level 4: User Intelligence
History, weaknesses, mastery and personalisation
        ↓
Situation Awareness
Current situation, attention target, risk,
feedback priority and recommended next action
        ↓
Structured Context Packet
Only compact interpreted information—not raw video
        ↓
OpenAI LLM Brain
Contextual reasoning and natural-language response
        ↓
Decision/Safety Controller
Validate the response against technique rules
        ↓
Voice, Text and Visual Feedback
        ↓
Session and User Memory
```

The LLM should not be described as the authority for:

- Joint-angle scoring
- Phase recognition
- Repetition counting
- Safety thresholds
- Movement validation

Those decisions should remain grounded in the models, rules and state machine. The LLM can interpret the structured situation and produce natural, context-aware communication.

## Offline model-development pipeline

The report should also contain a separate training pipeline:

```text
Participant recordings
        ↓
MediaPipe landmark extraction
        ↓
Manual phase and error annotation
        ↓
Data cleaning and normalisation
        ↓
Session/participant-separated dataset split
        ↓
Model training in Google Colab
        ↓
Validation and testing
        ↓
PyTorch model
        ↓
ONNX export
        ↓
Browser deployment
        ↓
Hybrid runtime evaluation
```

## Architecture diagrams we will eventually include

1. Combat Cognition conceptual framework
2. Complete system architecture
3. Real-time perception-to-feedback pipeline
4. Temporal reasoning architecture
5. Model-training and deployment pipeline
6. Situation-awareness and LLM interaction
7. Database and user-memory architecture
8. Hybrid rule/model decision flow

We are only agreeing on these figures now; we are not generating them yet.

## Evidence needed for the OpenAI component

My inspection of the current project did not find an OpenAI API call or OpenAI package. The current backend brain appears deterministic. The LLM may be in another version, external service or code not yet included.

Please provide:

- The file containing the OpenAI integration
- Exact OpenAI model name
- Prompt or system instructions
- Example structured input sent to the LLM
- Example LLM response
- Response format or JSON schema
- Screenshot or log of it working
- LLM response latency, if available
- Behaviour when the API is unavailable

Do not provide the API key or an unredacted `.env` file.

## Step 2 decision

Step 2 is accepted as:

- Framework: Combat Cognition
- Domain: martial-artist cognitive simulation
- Evaluation case study: Jab
- Current reasoning service: OpenAI LLM, subject to implementation verification
- Future reasoning service: privately trained/domain-specific LLM
- Complete martial-artist simulation: long-term vision
- Full perception–temporal reasoning–awareness–LLM–feedback pipeline: central research contribution

Once you show me where the OpenAI integration exists, we can close Step 2 completely and move to Step 3.

> yes next step

## Step 3: Research aim, objectives and success criteria

The objectives should cover the complete architecture while making Jab the experimental case study.

### Main research aim

> To design, implement and evaluate Combat Cognition, a hybrid perception–awareness–decision framework that simulates selected cognitive functions of a martial artist when observing, interpreting and assessing the Jab technique.

### Specific objectives

#### Objective 1 — Perception

> To develop a real-time perception layer that extracts body, hand and facial landmarks from camera input and converts them into normalised biomechanical measurements.

This covers MediaPipe, landmark confidence, body calibration, joint angles and camera-scale normalisation.

#### Objective 2 — Temporal reasoning

> To develop a multi-level temporal reasoning architecture that predicts short-term motion and recognises the ordered movement phases of a Jab.

This covers:

- ACP-STGAT motion prediction
- Universal temporal phase classification
- Preparation, extension, peak, retraction and recovery
- Tracking-loss and unknown-movement handling

#### Objective 3 — Hybrid movement assessment

> To integrate learned temporal predictions with biomechanical rules and deterministic state validation for explainable Jab assessment and repetition recognition.

This is one of the most important objectives because it represents the hybrid contribution.

#### Objective 4 — Situation awareness

> To develop multi-timescale situation awareness that combines motion, action, repetition, session and user-history information.

This covers:

- Level 1 motion intelligence
- Level 2 action intelligence
- Level 3 session intelligence
- Level 4 user intelligence
- Attention selection
- Repeated mistakes
- Consistency and performance trends
- Movement-quality deterioration risk

#### Objective 5 — Cognitive reasoning and feedback

> To integrate a grounded LLM reasoning layer that converts structured situation-awareness information into contextual martial-arts feedback while retaining deterministic validation and safety controls.

The report will state that OpenAI is the current LLM provider and that a domain-specific LLM can replace it in future.

#### Objective 6 — Memory and adaptation

> To implement session and user memory for recording performance, identifying recurring weaknesses and supporting personalised feedback.

#### Objective 7 — Model evaluation

> To evaluate the motion-prediction and temporal-classification models using appropriate prediction, classification and sequence-recognition metrics.

#### Objective 8 — Framework evaluation

> To evaluate the complete Combat Cognition Framework using Jab repetition accuracy, form-error detection, expert agreement, processing performance and user feedback.

## Measurable success criteria

| Component | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Perception | Tracking availability, landmark confidence and processing FPS |
| Motion prediction | Joint-position MAE/RMSE and prediction-horizon error |
| Phase model | Precision, recall, macro F1 and confusion matrix |
| Sequence reasoning | Phase-boundary error and invalid-transition rejection |
| Repetition recognition | Precision, recall, F1, count error and false repetitions |
| Form assessment | Agreement with martial-arts expert annotations |
| Situation awareness | Correct repeated-error, trend and recommendation decisions |
| LLM reasoning | Expert-rated correctness, relevance, grounding and safety |
| Complete system | End-to-end latency, FPS, reliability and usability |
| Hybrid contribution | Comparison with rule-only and model-only configurations |

We should not invent target percentages yet. Final thresholds should be selected after examining:

- Available data
- Current model results
- Baseline performance
- Number of participants
- Expert annotations
- Test hardware

## Proposed main research question

> How effectively can the Combat Cognition Framework integrate perception, temporal reasoning, situation awareness, grounded LLM reasoning and memory to simulate selected cognitive functions of a martial artist when assessing a Jab?

### Supporting research questions

1. How accurately can the learned models predict motion and recognise Jab phases?
2. Does the hybrid approach outperform rule-only and model-only configurations?
3. How accurately can the system recognise completed, incomplete and incorrect Jabs?
4. How closely do its form assessments and decisions agree with martial-arts experts?
5. Can structured situation awareness ground an LLM sufficiently to produce correct and relevant feedback?
6. Can the framework operate with acceptable real-time performance?

### Recommended primary hypothesis

> The hybrid Combat Cognition configuration will provide more reliable Jab recognition and assessment than either the rule-only or learned-model-only configuration.

Before approving Step 3, check your original proposal. If it contains previously approved objectives or research questions, send or paste them so we can align these objectives without contradicting the approved proposal. Otherwise, tell me whether you accept these eight objectives or want any removed.

> dont focus on Jab technique it as randomly selected tech for evaluvation
> not Universal temporal phase classification its good to be use phase classification

Agreed. The report should focus on the **Combat Cognition Framework**, not the Jab. The technique is only an evaluation instance used to test the framework.

One academic wording correction: we should only call the technique “randomly selected” if an actual random-selection procedure was used. Otherwise, use:

> **A selected martial-arts technique was used as a representative evaluation case.**

Later, the methodology can disclose that the selected technique was the Jab. This avoids making the whole research appear Jab-specific.

We will also use the general term **temporal phase-classification model**, not “universal temporal phase classification.”

## Revised main aim

> To design, implement and evaluate Combat Cognition, a hybrid cognitive framework that integrates visual perception, temporal reasoning, situation awareness, decision-making, language-model reasoning and memory to simulate selected cognitive functions of a martial artist.

## Revised specific objectives

### Objective 1 — Perception

> To develop a real-time perception layer that extracts and normalises body, hand and facial information from visual input for martial-arts movement analysis.

### Objective 2 — Motion prediction

> To develop a temporal motion-prediction layer that uses previous movement observations to estimate short-term future body motion.

### Objective 3 — Phase classification

> To develop a temporal phase-classification layer for identifying the ordered stages of a martial-arts movement.

This is deliberately model- and technique-independent in the objectives.

### Objective 4 — Hybrid reasoning

> To combine learned predictions, biomechanical measurements and deterministic temporal rules to produce explainable and reliable movement interpretations.

### Objective 5 — Hierarchical cognition

> To develop a hierarchical temporal reasoning architecture that connects motion-level, action-level, session-level and user-level intelligence.

### Objective 6 — Situation awareness

> To develop a situation-awareness layer that determines the current context, attention target, risks, feedback priority and appropriate next action.

### Objective 7 — LLM reasoning

> To integrate a grounded language-model reasoning component that converts structured cognitive context into relevant and natural feedback while retaining deterministic safety and movement validation.

### Objective 8 — Memory and adaptation

> To maintain session and user memory for identifying performance trends, recurring weaknesses and personalisation requirements.

### Objective 9 — Evaluation

> To evaluate the models, complete system and Combat Cognition Framework using a selected martial-arts technique as a representative experimental case.

## Revised main research question

> How effectively can a hybrid perception–temporal reasoning–awareness–decision architecture simulate selected cognitive functions associated with martial-arts movement understanding?

## Supporting research questions

1. How accurately can the temporal models predict motion and classify movement phases?
2. Does combining learned models with biomechanical and deterministic rules improve movement interpretation?
3. Can hierarchical temporal reasoning transform frame-level perception into session- and user-level awareness?
4. Can the situation-awareness layer select appropriate attention targets and next actions?
5. Can a grounded LLM produce feedback that is correct, relevant and consistent with structured system evidence?
6. Can the complete framework operate with acceptable real-time performance?
7. How effectively does the framework generalise conceptually beyond the technique used during evaluation?

## Evaluation positioning

The hierarchy will be:

```text
Research subject
Combat Cognition Framework

Implementation
General martial-arts cognitive architecture

Evaluation method
Representative technique case study

Selected evaluation technique
Jab

Future evaluation
Additional striking, kicking, blocking and defensive techniques
```

The results chapter may contain Jab-specific measurements because those are the actual experimental results. However:

- The title will not mention Jab.
- The main aim will not mention Jab.
- Most objectives will not mention Jab.
- The architectural description will remain technique-independent.
- Jab will appear only in the experimental setup and results.
- Limitations will acknowledge that evaluation using one technique cannot prove full cross-technique generalisation.

With these revisions, Step 3 is correctly focused on Combat Cognition rather than the evaluation technique.

> ok next step

## Step 4: Define the Combat Cognition architecture

This step determines exactly what the framework contains and how information moves through it. It will become the core of the Methodology chapter, but we are only defining it now.

## Proposed architecture

### 1. Input and perception

Inputs:

- Live camera
- Uploaded video for controlled testing
- Interactive skeleton for rule testing

Perception processing:

- Body landmark detection
- Hand landmark detection
- Face landmark detection
- Landmark visibility and confidence
- Body calibration
- Coordinate normalisation
- Mirrored/anatomical-side correction

Output:

> A structured observation of the martial artist’s visible physical state.

### 2. Low-level motion intelligence

Processing:

- Joint-angle calculation
- Position and displacement
- Velocity and acceleration
- Movement energy
- Landmark smoothing
- Tracking-loss detection
- Short-horizon kinematic prediction

Output:

> A continuously updated representation of how the body is moving.

### 3. Temporal reasoning engine

The two learned models should be presented as two complementary temporal reasoning mechanisms.

#### Model A: motion-prediction model

ACP-STGAT uses past landmark frames to estimate future body landmarks.

Purpose:

- Predict movement trajectory
- Support temporary tracking loss
- Estimate likely future motion
- Provide predictive evidence for action understanding

#### Model B: phase-classification model

Purpose:

- Classify the current movement phase
- Produce probabilities for possible phases
- Provide temporal evidence across a sequence
- Distinguish preparation, execution, peak, retraction and recovery

We will refer to it simply as:

> **Temporal phase-classification model**

The report does not need to call it “universal.”

### 4. Hybrid movement reasoning

This component combines:

- Motion-model predictions
- Phase-classification probabilities
- Biomechanical measurements
- Technique-specific rules
- State-transition constraints
- Minimum-duration conditions
- Tracking confidence
- Unknown-movement handling

The state machine verifies that movement phases occur in a valid order. Learned predictions provide evidence, but they do not directly create repetitions.

Output:

- Current action state
- Action confidence
- Completed or incomplete movement
- Form errors
- Repetition boundaries
- Explainable evidence

### 5. Hierarchical cognition

#### Level 1 — Motion cognition

Understands immediate body movement and tracking quality.

#### Level 2 — Action cognition

Understands movement phase, action probability, biomechanical errors and likely next movement.

#### Level 3 — Session cognition

Understands:

- Repetitions
- Consistency
- Performance trend
- Repeated mistakes
- Movement-quality deterioration
- Readiness to progress

Level 3 is currently an algorithmic cognitive layer, not a separately trained ML model.

#### Level 4 — User cognition

Understands:

- Historical performance
- Mastery
- Recurring weaknesses
- User level
- Personalisation
- Long-term progression

### 6. Situation awareness

The situation-awareness layer combines all four cognitive levels and determines:

- Current situation
- Most important attention target
- Tracking risk
- Mistake risk
- Performance deterioration risk
- Feedback priority
- Whether progression should pause
- Recommended next action
- Context to send to the reasoning brain

Example situation states:

- Observing
- Correcting
- Tracking unclear
- Warning
- Encouraging
- Ready to advance

### 7. Structured cognitive context

The system compresses the framework state into a structured packet containing:

- Motion context
- Action context
- Session context
- User context
- Situation state
- Attention target
- Recommended next action
- Current technique and step

This packet grounds the LLM. Raw video should not be sent to the LLM.

### 8. LLM cognitive brain

Current implementation:

- OpenAI LLM

Responsibilities:

- Interpret the structured cognitive context
- Generate natural explanations
- Adapt communication to the situation
- Maintain conversational continuity
- Produce relevant coaching feedback

Non-responsibilities:

- Direct landmark analysis
- Repetition counting
- Authoritative form scoring
- Overriding safety rules
- Inventing unavailable movement evidence

Future replacement:

> A locally hosted or domain-specific martial-arts LLM can replace OpenAI without redesigning the perception and awareness pipeline.

### 9. Decision validation

Before feedback reaches the user, a deterministic controller should validate:

- Whether the response agrees with observed evidence
- Whether the body part and error exist
- Whether progression is permitted
- Whether tracking is sufficiently reliable
- Whether the feedback duplicates a recent message
- Whether safety restrictions are satisfied

### 10. Response and action

Outputs:

- Voice feedback
- Text feedback
- Skeleton visualisation
- Joint-angle display
- Target-pose comparison
- Corrective overlays
- Continue, repeat, pause or advance decisions

### 11. Memory

Stored information:

- Training sessions
- Practice sessions
- Individual repetitions
- Accuracy and duration
- Feedback events
- Session recordings/tapes
- Analytics
- User calibration
- Recurring weaknesses
- Temporal-lab annotations

## Proposed original contributions

The report should present these as candidate contributions:

1. A perception–awareness–decision architecture for martial-artist cognitive simulation.
2. Integration of motion prediction and phase classification within one temporal reasoning engine.
3. Hybrid use of learned evidence, biomechanical rules and ordered-state validation.
4. Multi-timescale cognition spanning motion, action, session and user history.
5. A structured situation-awareness packet for grounding an LLM.
6. Separation of probabilistic LLM communication from authoritative movement validation.
7. A technique-extensible package architecture.
8. Browser-based real-time operation without requiring raw video to be sent to the LLM.

This architecture is suitable for Step 4. The remaining evidence we must later verify is the exact OpenAI integration and whether its responses currently pass through a deterministic validator. If no validator exists after the LLM, we must describe that as a limitation or add it before evaluation.

> also i think it good to be deep details about models and do we insert colab notebook/output that or other phase include that?

Yes, both models need detailed technical treatment. However, the complete Colab notebooks and raw output should not be pasted into the main report.

The report should separate:

```text
Chapter 3 — How the models were designed and trained

Chapter 4 — What results the models produced

Appendix/repository — Complete notebooks, logs and supporting outputs
```

## Chapter 3: Methodology

Create a separate subsection for each model.

### Model A: ACP-STGAT motion-prediction model

Include:

- Purpose within Combat Cognition
- Reason for selecting the architecture
- Input: 60 previous frames
- Input dimensions and 33 MediaPipe joints
- Coordinate dimensions
- Landmark normalisation
- Graph representation of body joints
- Spatial-temporal graph attention
- Action conditioning
- Velocity and acceleration features
- Physics-informed prior
- Joint-attention mechanism
- Prediction output: 30 future frames
- Loss functions
- Optimiser
- Learning rate
- Batch size
- Number of epochs
- Training/validation/test split
- ONNX conversion
- Browser integration
- Relationship with Level 1 and Level 2
- Limitations

A model architecture diagram should show:

```text
Past 60 landmark frames
        ↓
Normalisation
        ↓
Velocity and acceleration extraction
        ↓
Spatial body graph
        ↓
Temporal graph-attention layers
        ↓
Action conditioning + physics prior
        ↓
Future landmark decoder
        ↓

```

### Model B: temporal phase-classification model

Include:

- Purpose
- Input landmark sequence
- Sequence length
- Input tensor dimensions
- Landmark normalisation
- Graph-convolution component
- Temporal-convolution component
- Phase labels
- Classification head
- Loss function
- Optimiser and hyperparameters
- Training, validation and test splitting
- Class imbalance handling
- ONNX export
- Phase-probability output
- Integration with the state machine
- Confidence threshold
- Rule/model evidence blending
- Limitations

Its diagram can show:

```text
Landmark sequence
        ↓
Hip-centred and torso-scale normalisation
        ↓
Spatial graph encoding
        ↓
Temporal feature extraction
        ↓
Phase-classification head
        ↓
Phase probabilities
        ↓
Ordered-state validation
```

Although we use the general phrase “phase-classification model” in the objectives, Chapter 3 must identify the exact implemented architecture and model version. We should not hide technical implementation details merely to keep the framework generic.

## Chapter 4: Results and Discussion

### Model A results

Include:

- Training and validation loss
- Joint-position MAE/RMSE
- Error at different prediction horizons
- Per-joint prediction error
- Velocity and acceleration error
- Baseline comparison
- Example predicted versus actual trajectories
- Inference time
- Discussion of failure cases

### Model B results

Include:

- Training and validation loss
- Per-phase precision, recall and F1
- Macro and weighted F1
- Confusion matrix
- Phase-boundary timing error
- Repetition precision, recall and F1
- False repetitions
- Rule-only, model-only and hybrid comparison
- Failure examples and discussion

The currently recorded phase-model results must be included honestly:

- Validation macro F1: approximately 0.744
- Test macro F1: approximately 0.472

We need the Colab outputs to determine why validation and test performance differ.

## System and framework results

After the individual model results, Chapter 4 should contain:

1. Perception performance
2. Temporal-reasoning performance
3. Hybrid movement-recognition results
4. Situation-awareness correctness
5. LLM response evaluation
6. End-to-end latency and FPS
7. Expert agreement
8. User evaluation
9. Ablation comparison
10. Limitations

This moves the discussion from individual components to the complete Combat Cognition Framework.

## What belongs in the appendices

Suitable appendix material includes:

- Important Colab code sections
- Complete hyperparameter tables
- Model metadata
- Additional confusion matrices
- Additional training graphs
- Dataset schema
- Annotation instructions
- Sample anonymised landmark sequence
- Example structured context packet
- LLM prompt and response schema
- Evaluation questionnaire
- Expert-assessment form
- Additional test results
- Links to complete notebooks and source code

Do not insert hundreds of notebook cells or raw console output into the report. That makes the report difficult to read.

## What should be externally linked

The full reproducibility package may contain:

- Complete `.ipynb` notebooks
- Source code repository
- Environment requirements
- Dataset preparation scripts
- Model metadata
- Anonymised evaluation data
- Supplementary results

The report should link to a stable repository version or release. If it is private, the supervisor and examiners must receive access.

## What I need from you for the model sections

Please provide the following for each model:

- Original `.ipynb` notebook
- Exported notebook with visible outputs, preferably HTML or PDF
- Training log
- Training and validation graphs
- Test report JSON
- Confusion matrix
- Model metadata JSON
- Dataset summary
- Label definitions
- Hyperparameters
- Random seed
- Hardware/GPU used
- Training duration
- Best checkpoint criteria
- Number of experiments or training runs
- Any baseline results
- Any failed or incomplete experiments

You do not need to provide the large `.pt` or `.onnx` files unless we need to rerun inference.

If only one training run exists, we will report it as a single-run experiment and identify that limitation. If multiple runs exist, we should report the mean and standard deviation rather than selecting only the best run.

So yes: **deep model details belong in Methodology, selected model outputs belong in Results, and full Colab notebooks belong in the appendices or reproducibility repository.**

> ok move next step

## Step 5: Dataset and evidence design

Before discussing evaluation metrics, we must establish exactly what data trained the models and what independent data will test the framework.

The report should distinguish three datasets:

```text
Model-training data
Used to learn model parameters

Validation data
Used for model selection and tuning

Independent evaluation data
Used once for final model and system evaluation
```

## Proposed data pipeline

```text
Participant movement/video
        ↓
Consent and participant coding
        ↓
MediaPipe landmark extraction
        ↓
Body-centred normalisation
        ↓
Manual movement annotation
        ↓
Annotation quality review
        ↓
Participant/session-level splitting
        ↓
Training, validation and testing
        ↓
Independent system evaluation
```

## Information stored for each recording

Each session should ideally contain:

- Anonymous participant ID
- Session ID
- Technique ID
- Recording date
- Camera position and distance
- Frame rate
- Landmark coordinates
- Landmark visibility
- Body side or stance
- Movement speed
- Movement phases
- Repetition boundaries
- Correct/incorrect status
- Form-error labels
- Tracking-loss intervals
- Annotation status
- Data origin: real or synthetic

No participant name needs to appear in the dataset.

## Required movement categories

The evaluation dataset should include:

- Correct executions
- Incorrect executions
- Incomplete executions
- Slow executions
- Fast executions
- Held poses
- Unrelated movements
- Movements before or after cues
- Temporary tracking loss
- Different camera distances
- Different body proportions
- Participants unseen during training

This prevents the evaluation from containing only easy, correct examples.

## Phase labels

The phase-classification dataset should have clearly defined labels such as:

- Preparation
- Entry
- Execution
- Peak
- Retraction
- Recovery
- Unknown movement
- Tracking lost

The exact phases must match the implemented model metadata and state machine.

## Real and synthetic data

Synthetic data may be used for:

- Pipeline development
- Unit testing
- Bootstrap pretraining
- Generating rare failure conditions

However:

> Synthetic-only test results cannot demonstrate real-world effectiveness.

The final evaluation must use human-performed movement recordings that were not used during training.

## Recommended participant strategy

A practical target is:

- 15–20 participants
- Different experience levels
- Multiple valid repetitions per participant
- Several incorrect and incomplete attempts
- At least one independent martial-arts evaluator

If participant numbers are limited, use participant-grouped cross-validation. Do not randomly distribute frames from the same recording across training and testing.

### Recommended splitting

With sufficient participants:

- 60% training participants
- 20% validation participants
- 20% test participants

With a small participant group:

- Grouped k-fold cross-validation, or
- Leave-one-participant-out evaluation

## Ground-truth annotation

A martial-arts expert should ideally annotate:

- Movement start and end
- Movement phases
- Completed repetitions
- Incorrect or incomplete movements
- Body-part errors
- Overall form quality
- Appropriate feedback
- Whether the user should continue, repeat, pause or advance

If two experts are available, we can measure inter-rater agreement. If only one is available, we will disclose that limitation.

## Data needed for the two models

### Motion-prediction model

We need to know:

- Source of landmark sequences
- Number of recordings
- Number of participants
- Past/future window generation
- Whether data are real, synthetic or mixed
- Train/validation/test split
- Normalisation
- Loss functions
- Baseline results

### Phase-classification model

We need:

- Number of sessions
- Total frames/sequences
- Phase distribution
- Human-verified sessions
- Synthetic sessions
- Unknown and tracking-loss samples
- Participant/session split
- Class imbalance handling
- Final test-set composition

## Ethics and privacy

Before collecting new participant data:

- Obtain informed consent
- Explain camera and landmark collection
- State whether videos are stored
- Allow withdrawal
- Replace names with participant codes
- Restrict access to raw recordings
- Store only landmarks where possible
- Avoid sending raw video or identifiable information to the LLM

The report may require an ethics statement even if the university does not require formal ethical approval.

## Step 5 information I need from you

Please answer these based on what currently exists:

1. How many real people were used to create the existing model data?
2. Is the current training data real, synthetic or a mixture?
3. Do you have manually labelled movement phases?
4. Do you have access to a qualified martial-arts instructor for ground-truth evaluation?
5. Can you collect new participant recordings before submission?
6. Do you already have participant consent or university ethical approval?
7. Where are the actual training datasets: local computer, Google Drive or Colab?

If you do not know some answers, say “unknown.” We will inspect the notebooks and data rather than guessing.

</details>

This is useful evidence. We can now document the ACP-STGAT branch more accurately.

## Important dataset correction

`Andyen512/DDHpose` is an official model/code repository for DDHPose, not a standalone dataset. Its documentation states that it uses:

- Human3.6M
- MPI-INF-3DHP

It presents DDHPose as a diffusion-based 3D human-pose-estimation model published at AAAI 2024. [Hugging Face DDHPose repository](https://huggingface.co/Andyen512/DDHpose)

Therefore, we must determine whether you:

1. Used Human3.6M data from the DDHPose repository;
2. Used MPI-INF-3DHP data;
3. Used DDHPose-generated predictions;
4. Adapted DDHPose code or preprocessing;
5. Or used another dataset downloaded through that repository.

We should not write “DDHPose dataset” until the notebook confirms the underlying data.

## Confirmed ACP-STGAT specification

Based on the system and your explanation:

| Property | Current information |
|---|---|
| Model | ACP-STGAT |
| Full name | Action-Conditioned Physics-Informed Spatial-Temporal Graph Attention model |
| Input | 60 recent live skeleton frames |
| Input skeleton | 33 landmarks |
| Coordinates | Three-dimensional landmark coordinates |
| Output | 30 predicted future frames |
| Prediction output | 33 future landmarks per frame |
| Runtime | ONNX Runtime Web |
| Visualisation | Blue dashed future skeleton |
| L1 visualisation | Yellow/orange short-term prediction |
| Intended uses | Forecast awareness, coaching context, visual prediction and tracking-noise support |

## What the screenshot proves

The screenshot provides implementation evidence that:

- The Admin Studio accepts a live camera feed.
- The Level 1 skeleton layer is active.
- The ACP runtime reports `Ready`.
- A blue dashed predicted skeleton is rendered.
- Live body, hand and face analysis is displayed.
- Technique steps and full-body assessment are integrated into the same interface.
- The prediction system operates inside the broader training environment.

A suitable future caption would be:

> **Figure X.X: Admin Studio showing the observed Level 1 skeleton and the ACP-STGAT predicted future-pose overlay during live movement analysis.**

However, the screenshot proves that the feature is integrated and operational. It does **not** prove prediction accuracy. That requires the Colab test results.

Because the screenshot contains an identifiable face, we should either:

- Obtain permission to include it;
- Crop the image to the skeleton and relevant controls; or
- Blur the face before inserting it into the report.

## Precise architectural role

The implementation shows that ACP-STGAT predictions are:

- Generated inside Level 2 action processing;
- Recorded in a prediction ledger;
- Compared with observed landmarks;
- Used to derive forecast awareness;
- Included in the structured coaching-context packet;
- Available for predicted-skeleton visualisation;
- Available as fallback support when observations are unreliable.

One clarification is needed for the report:

> Level 3 session calculations currently appear to use the resulting action state, repetition events, mistakes and tracking evidence rather than directly calculating session scores from the 30 predicted frames.

Therefore, we can say ACP-STGAT **supports the wider awareness and coaching pipeline**, but we should not claim that Level 3 directly consumes predicted coordinates unless the Colab/system version contains additional logic.

## Evaluation required for ACP-STGAT

For motion prediction, “accuracy” alone is not an appropriate metric. We need:

- Mean Per-Joint Position Error
- MAE or RMSE
- Error at 1, 5, 10, 20 and 30 future frames
- Per-joint prediction error
- Velocity error
- Acceleration error
- Prediction-versus-observation agreement
- Tracking-loss recovery performance
- Model inference time
- Comparison against last-pose and linear-motion baselines

## What to provide next

Please provide the ACP-STGAT materials first:

1. Colab `.ipynb` file with outputs
2. Any exported Colab PDF or HTML
3. Training and validation graphs
4. Test metrics
5. Dataset-loading cells
6. Dataset preprocessing cells
7. Dataset size and sequence count
8. Training/validation/test split
9. Hyperparameters
10. Best-model selection output
11. GPU/runtime information
12. Any comparison or baseline output

The `.ipynb` file is the highest priority because it should reveal the actual data source, model layers, loss functions, split method and test results.

## Step 5 status

We have now established:

- ACP-STGAT exists in the implemented system.
- It accepts recent skeleton sequences.
- It predicts 30 future frames containing 33 landmarks.
- It is operational through ONNX in Admin Studio.
- The screenshot is valid integration evidence.
- Quantitative accuracy is still awaiting Colab evidence.
- The exact underlying dataset still requires notebook verification.

Please upload the ACP-STGAT Colab notebook next. We will inspect it before moving to the phase-classification dataset.

> next step and after all ur clarifcation and discussion we recreate colabs for that 2 models with evaluvation metrixs,accuray,testing out put ,... and other nessecery things

Agreed. We will first finish every clarification and research-design decision. After that, we will recreate two clean, reproducible Colab notebooks:

1. ACP-STGAT motion-prediction notebook
2. Temporal phase-classification notebook

We will preserve the existing notebooks and create new research-quality versions containing dataset documentation, reproducible training, evaluation metrics, graphs, testing output, baselines and ONNX export.

# Step 6: Temporal phase-classification model

## Purpose within Combat Cognition

The phase-classification model answers:

> What stage of the martial-arts movement is currently occurring?

Its output becomes evidence for temporal reasoning. It should not directly count repetitions without state-machine validation.

## Proposed input and output

### Input

- Sequence of MediaPipe body landmarks
- 33 joints
- x, y, z and visibility
- Hip-centred normalisation
- Torso-scale normalisation
- Sequence length currently configured as 90 frames

### Output phases

- Preparation
- Entry
- Execution
- Peak
- Retraction
- Recovery
- Unknown movement
- Tracking lost

Not every technique needs to use every canonical phase. Technique configuration maps canonical phases to its native movement states.

## Proposed architecture

The current implementation identifies the architecture as a technique-conditioned ST-GCN/TCN model:

```text
Landmark sequence
        ↓
Spatial graph representation
        ↓
Joint-level graph convolution
        ↓
Shared pose encoding
        ↓
Temporal convolution
        ↓
Technique conditioning
        ↓
Frame-level phase logits
        ↓
Softmax phase probabilities
        ↓
Ordered-state decoder
```

In the report, we will call it the **temporal phase-classification model**. The exact ST-GCN/TCN implementation will be explained in the Methodology chapter.

## Model output versus framework output

We must evaluate two different outputs.

### Raw model output

The model predicts a phase for each frame.

Evaluate with:

- Per-phase precision
- Per-phase recall
- Per-phase F1
- Macro F1
- Weighted F1
- Balanced accuracy
- Confusion matrix
- Unknown-movement detection
- Tracking-loss detection

### Hybrid framework output

The ordered decoder processes phase probabilities and produces valid movement sequences.

Evaluate with:

- Completed repetition precision
- Completed repetition recall
- Repetition F1
- Repetition-count error
- False repetitions per minute
- Incomplete-movement detection
- Movement-boundary timing error
- Impossible-transition rejection
- Tracking-loss recovery

This separation will show whether the state machine improves the raw model output.

## Required comparison

The strongest experiment contains:

| Configuration | Description |
|---|---|
| Rule-only | Biomechanical and temporal rules without phase-model probabilities |
| Model-only | Phase predictions without deterministic ordered validation |
| Hybrid | Model predictions combined with rules and ordered validation |

The principal hypothesis is:

> The hybrid configuration will provide more reliable movement interpretation than either the rule-only or model-only configuration.

## Required training data

Every real recording should contain:

- Participant/session ID
- Technique identifier
- Landmark frames
- Frame timestamps
- Manually annotated phases
- Completed/incomplete status
- Movement boundaries
- Tracking-loss labels
- Unknown-movement examples
- Human-verification status

Synthetic data can support initial training, but final evaluation must use unseen human recordings.

## Recreated Colab structure

The final research-quality phase-classification notebook will contain:

1. Environment and dependency installation
2. Random-seed configuration
3. Dataset loading
4. Dataset integrity validation
5. Real/synthetic data separation
6. Participant/session summary
7. Class-distribution graphs
8. Landmark visualisation
9. Normalisation verification
10. Participant-grouped splitting
11. Model architecture summary
12. Parameter count
13. Training configuration
14. Training and validation loop
15. Checkpoint selection
16. Loss and metric graphs
17. Test-set evaluation
18. Per-phase metrics
19. Confusion matrix
20. Sequence-level evaluation
21. Repetition-level evaluation
22. Rule-only/model-only/hybrid comparison
23. Failure-case analysis
24. Inference-time measurement
25. ONNX export
26. ONNX-versus-PyTorch consistency test
27. Metadata export
28. Reproducibility summary

## Recreated ACP-STGAT notebook

The ACP-STGAT notebook will similarly contain:

- Verified source dataset
- Sequence conversion to MediaPipe-compatible 33 joints
- Train/validation/test separation
- Model architecture
- Loss terms
- Prediction-horizon evaluation
- Per-joint errors
- Baseline comparison
- Noise and missing-landmark experiments
- Runtime measurements
- Visual predicted-versus-actual examples
- ONNX export and consistency testing

We should not overwrite the current notebooks or models. New files can use names such as:

- `acp_stgat_research_evaluation_v2.ipynb`
- `temporal_phase_research_evaluation_v2.ipynb`

## Information needed to close Step 6

For the phase-classification model, tell me:

1. Did you use the Admin Temporal Data Lab to record real movement sequences?
2. Do you have manually labelled, human-verified phase recordings?
3. Is the current model trained using synthetic data, real data or both?
4. Where are those recordings stored?
5. Approximately how many recordings or sessions exist?
6. Was the current model trained using the existing `colab_universal_training.ipynb`, `colab_jab_training.ipynb`, or another notebook?

If the answers are unknown, that is fine. We can inspect the files and Colab outputs later.

> for testing in colab can we use video recode or any public data sorces or any other option .so i think it good to be those 2 model firsly test ,acuracy ,.. check inside colab then inside system .are u agree

<details><summary>2 previous messages</summary>

> I agree with the two-stage strategy: first evaluate both models offline in Colab, then evaluate the exported models inside the complete system. I’m checking suitable public sources because the correct test data differs between motion forecasting and phase classification.

</details>

Yes, I agree completely:

> **First evaluate both models independently in Colab. Then export them to ONNX and evaluate them inside the complete Combat Cognition system.**

This is the correct academic approach because a model can perform well offline but behave differently after conversion, browser deployment and integration.

## Recommended three-stage evaluation

```text
Stage 1: Offline model evaluation in Colab
                    ↓
Stage 2: ONNX consistency and browser-runtime evaluation
                    ↓
Stage 3: End-to-end Combat Cognition system evaluation
```

# Stage 1: Colab model evaluation

## Model A: ACP-STGAT

### Best data strategy

Use a combination of:

1. **Public 3D pose data** for quantitative benchmarking
2. **Martial-arts recordings** for domain-specific testing
3. **Your own videos** for MediaPipe-compatible testing

### Suitable public sources

#### Human3.6M

Useful for general human-motion training and testing because it provides corresponding 3D pose data. It is not martial-arts-specific. [Official Human3.6M information](https://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m/readme_challenge.php)

#### MPI-INF-3DHP

Useful as a second 3D human-pose benchmark. The original DDHPose implementation documents evaluation using Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. [DDHPose repository](https://huggingface.co/Andyen512/DDHpose)

#### MADS

The Martial Arts, Dancing and Sports dataset is particularly relevant. It contains Tai Chi, Karate, dance and sports recordings with synchronized motion-capture ground truth. The published description reports 30 multiview videos, 30 stereo-depth videos and approximately 53,000 frames. [MADS publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026288561730046X)

MADS is a good cross-domain test source, although its skeleton structure must be mapped to the model’s 33-landmark representation.

### Own recorded videos

Yes, we can use recorded videos:

```text
Recorded video
      ↓
MediaPipe extraction
      ↓
Observed 33-landmark sequence
      ↓
Past 60 frames sent to ACP-STGAT
      ↓
Predicted next 30 frames
      ↓
Compare predictions with the actual following 30 MediaPipe frames
```

This gives a valid test of whether ACP-STGAT predicts future **MediaPipe observations**.

However, it is not true motion-capture ground truth. The report must distinguish:

- MoCap/3D ground truth evaluation
- MediaPipe pseudo-ground-truth evaluation

### ACP-STGAT metrics

- MPJPE where calibrated 3D ground truth exists
- Normalised MPJPE for MediaPipe coordinates
- Average Displacement Error
- Final Displacement Error
- MAE and RMSE
- Per-joint error
- Bone-length consistency error
- Velocity and acceleration error
- Prediction error at several future horizons
- PCK, if an appropriate threshold is defined
- Noise robustness
- Missing-landmark robustness
- Inference latency

“Accuracy” by itself is not ideal for coordinate prediction. We can only report an accuracy percentage if we define a threshold-based measure such as PCK.

# Model B: temporal phase classification

## Best data strategy

The phase model requires phase labels. Ordinary public videos do not provide your required labels automatically.

We can use:

- Your own recorded videos
- Appropriately licensed public martial-arts videos
- MADS martial-arts sequences where suitable
- Synthetic bootstrap sequences
- Admin Temporal Data Lab recordings

Every selected video must be manually labelled with:

- Preparation
- Entry
- Execution
- Peak
- Retraction
- Recovery
- Unknown movement
- Tracking lost

For this model, your own controlled recordings are likely the strongest source because the camera conditions match the final system.

### Phase-model metrics

- Overall accuracy
- Balanced accuracy
- Per-phase precision
- Per-phase recall
- Per-phase F1
- Macro F1
- Weighted F1
- Confusion matrix
- Boundary timing error
- Unknown-movement detection
- Tracking-loss detection
- Repetition precision, recall and F1 after decoding

Synthetic data may be used for training or development, but the final test set must contain real human movement.

# Stage 2: ONNX and browser evaluation

After training, each notebook should:

1. Save the best PyTorch checkpoint.
2. Export the model to ONNX.
3. Run identical test inputs through PyTorch and ONNX.
4. Compare outputs numerically.
5. Confirm that ONNX conversion does not materially change predictions.
6. Measure ONNX inference latency.
7. Validate the expected input/output tensor shapes.

For ACP-STGAT:

```text
PyTorch future landmarks ≈ ONNX future landmarks
```

For phase classification:

```text
PyTorch phase probabilities ≈ ONNX phase probabilities
```

We should report maximum and average numerical differences.

# Stage 3: Complete-system evaluation

After the models pass offline testing, evaluate them in Admin Studio using:

- Recorded videos
- Uploaded videos
- Live camera
- Correct movement
- Incorrect movement
- Incomplete movement
- Slow and fast movement
- Tracking loss
- Noise and occlusion
- Unrelated actions

Measure:

- Model loading success
- Browser inference time
- Frame rate
- Prediction stability
- Phase recognition
- Repetition counting
- Form-error detection
- Feedback correctness
- Situation-awareness decisions
- LLM response quality
- Overall response latency

## Required experimental comparison

Test the same videos in three configurations:

1. Rule-only
2. Model-only
3. Hybrid Combat Cognition

Because the same recordings are used for all configurations, the comparison will be controlled and defensible.

## Recommended final data arrangement

```text
Dataset A
Public 3D pose sequences
Purpose: ACP-STGAT benchmark testing

Dataset B
Martial-arts/public motion sequences
Purpose: cross-domain motion-prediction testing

Dataset C
Manually labelled movement videos
Purpose: phase-classification testing

Dataset D
Independent live/user recordings
Purpose: complete-system evaluation
```

No training participant or recording should appear in the final test data.

## Decision

This evaluation strategy is approved:

- Test both models separately in Colab first.
- Use public datasets where appropriate.
- Use recorded videos for domain-specific evaluation.
- Manually annotate phases.
- Validate PyTorch and ONNX consistency.
- Test both ONNX models inside Admin Studio.
- Evaluate the complete framework last.
- Report model results separately from system results.

After all discussion steps are complete, we will create the two evaluation-ready Colab notebooks and preserve the existing notebooks.

> ok lets move next step if ok that steps

Steps 1–6 are acceptable. We now have an agreed research identity, objectives, architecture, data strategy and model-evaluation sequence.

# Step 7: Complete system and framework evaluation

This step evaluates whether Combat Cognition works as an integrated cognitive framework—not merely whether its individual models produce outputs.

## Evaluation hierarchy

```text
Software verification
        ↓
Individual model evaluation
        ↓
Hybrid reasoning evaluation
        ↓
Situation-awareness evaluation
        ↓
LLM evaluation
        ↓
End-to-end system evaluation
        ↓
User and expert evaluation
```

## 1. Software verification

The existing automated tests provide implementation evidence:

- 126 frontend tests
- 23 backend tests
- 149 tests in total

These verify logic such as:

- Phase ordering
- Tracking-loss handling
- Repetition boundaries
- Form scoring
- Session analytics
- Technique-package validation
- Coaching-state behaviour
- Authentication and password-reset behaviour

These tests demonstrate software correctness under defined scenarios, not real-world model accuracy.

## 2. Controlled recorded-video experiment

Use one fixed evaluation dataset containing:

- Correct movements
- Deliberately incorrect movements
- Incomplete movements
- Slow and fast movements
- Held poses
- Unrelated movements
- Temporary occlusion
- Tracking loss
- Different camera distances and orientations

Every video should have expert ground truth:

- Movement phases
- Repetition boundaries
- Completed/incomplete status
- Form errors
- Correct system decision
- Expected feedback focus

The same videos must be processed by every system configuration.

## 3. Ablation experiment

Test four configurations:

| Configuration | Components |
|---|---|
| A: Rule-only | Biomechanical rules and deterministic temporal logic |
| B: Model-only | Learned temporal evidence without hybrid verification |
| C: Hybrid without LLM | Models, rules, awareness and template feedback |
| D: Complete Combat Cognition | Models, rules, awareness, OpenAI LLM and memory |

This experiment will show the contribution of each major component.

### Main comparisons

- A versus B: rules compared with learned models
- A/B versus C: value of hybrid reasoning
- C versus D: value added by grounded LLM communication

## 4. Movement-understanding evaluation

Measure:

- Phase-classification performance
- Completed-repetition detection
- Incomplete-movement detection
- False repetitions
- Form-error detection
- Movement-boundary timing
- Tracking-loss recovery
- Unknown-movement rejection

Recommended metrics:

- Precision
- Recall
- F1
- Balanced accuracy
- Count MAE
- False repetitions per minute
- Boundary error in milliseconds
- Confusion matrices

## 5. Situation-awareness evaluation

Create test cases with known expected outcomes:

| Scenario | Expected awareness |
|---|---|
| Low tracking confidence | Tracking unclear |
| Persistent form error | Correcting |
| Repeated session mistake | Repeat current step |
| Declining movement quality | Warning or slow down |
| High consistency | Ready to advance |
| Stable acceptable movement | Continue or observe |
| Known user weakness repeats | Personalised correction |

Compare the system’s awareness output with expert decisions.

Metrics:

- Situation-state accuracy
- Attention-target accuracy
- Recommendation accuracy
- Precision, recall and F1
- Agreement with experts
- Incorrect-progression rate

## 6. LLM evaluation

The OpenAI LLM should be evaluated separately from movement recognition.

### LLM test input

Store structured context packets from controlled sessions and replay them through the LLM.

### Evaluate each response for:

- Groundedness
- Technical correctness
- Relevance
- Clarity
- Actionability
- Consistency with the attention target
- Safety
- Unsupported claims
- Contradiction with system evidence

### Recommended LLM metrics

- Expert correctness rating
- Relevance rating
- Groundedness rating
- Safety rating
- Unsupported-claim rate
- Contradiction rate
- Valid-response-format rate
- Response latency
- API failure rate

Record:

- Exact OpenAI model
- Model version/snapshot
- Prompt version
- Temperature
- Maximum output length
- Test date

### LLM comparison

Compare:

- Template-based feedback
- OpenAI-generated feedback

This tests whether the LLM improves communication without reducing correctness.

## 7. End-to-end performance evaluation

Measure each stage separately:

- MediaPipe processing time
- Motion-model inference time
- Phase-model inference time
- Hybrid-reasoning time
- Situation-awareness processing time
- LLM response time
- Database/storage time
- Total feedback latency
- Browser FPS
- Memory utilisation
- Model-loading time

Report median, mean and 95th-percentile latency where possible.

Separate:

```text
Local real-time latency
Perception → awareness → visual feedback

Network-dependent latency
Context packet → OpenAI → language response
```

The system may remain visually responsive while waiting for the LLM.

## 8. Robustness evaluation

Test controlled disturbances:

- Landmark noise
- Random missing landmarks
- Consecutive missing frames
- Camera movement
- Partial-body visibility
- Poor lighting
- Mirrored input
- Fast execution
- Slow execution
- User outside the camera frame
- LLM/API unavailable

Expected behaviour should be safe degradation, such as:

- Avoiding false repetitions
- Reporting tracking uncertainty
- Falling back to deterministic feedback
- Avoiding unsupported corrections
- Continuing local processing when the LLM is unavailable

## 9. Expert evaluation

A martial-arts expert should review:

- Phase labels
- Completed repetitions
- Form errors
- Attention targets
- Continue/repeat/advance decisions
- LLM feedback

Useful agreement measures:

- Percentage agreement
- Cohen’s kappa for categorical decisions
- Spearman correlation for ordinal form scores
- MAE for numerical scores

If only one expert is available, report that as a limitation.

## 10. User evaluation

Participants can complete:

1. A short baseline movement without feedback
2. A movement session with Combat Cognition
3. A post-session questionnaire

Measure:

- Ease of use
- Feedback clarity
- Feedback relevance
- Trust
- Perceived responsiveness
- Visualisation usefulness
- Voice-feedback usefulness
- Overall usability
- Willingness to use the system again

If expert scoring is available before and after feedback, we can also investigate whether form quality improved.

## Recommended participant target

- Preferred: 15–20 participants
- Minimum prototype study: approximately 10 participants
- Multiple attempts per participant
- Different experience levels
- Participant-coded and consented data
- At least one independent expert evaluator

If fewer participants are available, present the work as a pilot evaluation and avoid broad generalisation.

## Evidence required from Admin Studio

Useful screenshots or recordings include:

- Live observed skeleton
- L1 predicted skeleton
- ACP-STGAT predicted skeleton
- Phase probabilities
- Situation-awareness panel
- Repetition timeline
- Form-error output
- LLM context and response
- Rule-only/model-only/hybrid results
- Analysis dashboard
- Tracking-loss behaviour

## Step 7 information needed

Please tell me later:

1. Approximately how many people can participate?
2. Can a martial-arts instructor evaluate the recordings?
3. What computer/browser will run the final test?
4. Can you record test sessions?
5. Is your OpenAI integration able to save anonymised input/output logs?
6. Can the system switch between rule-only, model-only and hybrid configurations?

If some capabilities are missing, we can add the required evaluation controls after completing the discussion.

> 1. 3
> 2. yes its me i am professional martial artist
> 3. this lap
> 4. it already recoding during practice i think
> 5. dont know
> 6. model is good cosider future?

These answers mean the evaluation is feasible, but it must be presented as a **pilot case study**, not a general population study.

## Revised Step 7 plan

### 1. Three participants

Three participants are acceptable for a prototype/pilot evaluation, especially when combined with many controlled movement attempts.

However:

- The effective participant sample remains three.
- Performing many repetitions does not turn three participants into a large study.
- We cannot claim broad generalisation across martial artists.
- Results should be presented per participant as well as combined.

Recommended positioning:

> A pilot evaluation was conducted with three participants to assess technical feasibility and obtain preliminary evidence of the Combat Cognition Framework.

Each participant should perform several controlled conditions:

- Correct movement
- Deliberately incorrect movement
- Incomplete movement
- Slow movement
- Fast movement
- Unrelated movement
- Temporary occlusion or tracking loss

This can still produce enough movements for technical metrics such as repetition precision and phase F1.

### 2. You as the martial-arts expert

Your professional experience is valuable, but because you developed the system, your assessment is not independent. This creates researcher-evaluator bias.

Best option:

> Ask another instructor or experienced martial artist to independently review at least part of the evaluation data.

If that is impossible:

- State your martial-arts qualifications clearly.
- Use a predefined annotation rubric.
- Label recordings without viewing system predictions.
- Evaluate the same recordings again after a time gap.
- Report this as researcher-expert evaluation.
- Acknowledge the absence of an independent evaluator as a limitation.

Do not describe it as independent expert validation if you are the system developer and sole evaluator.

### 3. Testing laptop

The laptop can be the defined test environment. Later, we will record:

- Laptop model
- CPU
- GPU
- RAM
- Operating system
- Browser and version
- Camera resolution
- Camera frame rate
- ONNX Runtime version
- MediaPipe version

All performance results will be explicitly tied to this hardware.

### 4. Practice recording

The Practice system currently stores a **session tape**, not necessarily the original camera video.

The tape contains information such as:

- Frame timestamps
- Pose landmarks
- Angles and scores
- Movement labels
- Repetition information
- Tracking evidence
- Corrected post-session labels
- Metadata

This is excellent for:

- Offline replay
- Rule-only/model-only/hybrid comparison
- Recalculating results
- Phase and repetition evaluation
- Failure analysis

However, a skeleton tape may not be sufficient for an expert to judge every visible error. If possible, record the original video separately for the controlled study and synchronise it with the session tape.

### 5. LLM logging

We must verify this later. A research-quality LLM log should store:

- Anonymous session ID
- Timestamp
- Prompt version
- Model name/version
- Structured context packet
- LLM response
- Response latency
- Validation result
- Fallback status
- User-visible final message

It should not store:

- API keys
- Raw video
- Participant names
- Unnecessary facial information

If logging does not currently exist, we can add it after completing the research discussion.

### 6. Model-only configuration

Model evaluation cannot be moved entirely to future work because the models are part of the current framework.

Recommended minimum comparison:

1. **Rule-only**
2. **Hybrid model + rules**

The phase model should also be evaluated independently in Colab. A fully deployed “model-only” system is not required because allowing an unverified model to control repetitions may be unsafe or inconsistent.

Therefore:

- Model-only metrics: evaluate offline in Colab.
- Rule-only system: evaluate using stored tapes.
- Hybrid system: evaluate using the same tapes.
- Full LLM-versus-template ablation: include if implementation and time permit.
- Broader evaluation across additional techniques: future work.

## Final feasible evaluation design

```text
Model evaluation
Public/recorded test data in Colab
        ↓
ONNX consistency evaluation
PyTorch versus browser model
        ↓
Controlled pilot study
3 participants and multiple movement conditions
        ↓
Stored tape replay
Rule-only versus hybrid
        ↓
Expert assessment
Researcher-expert rubric, ideally with second evaluator
        ↓
End-to-end performance
Latency, FPS, correctness and robustness
```

## Step 7 conclusion

Step 7 is accepted with these limitations:

- Three-participant pilot study
- Selected-technique evaluation
- Researcher-expert assessment
- Independent evaluator recommended
- Laptop-specific performance results
- Practice tapes used for replay
- Original video recorded where possible
- Model testing completed now, not deferred
- Cross-technique and large-participant studies treated as future work

This remains sufficient for an independent-study report if the limitations are reported honestly and the technical evaluation is thorough.

> any next steps??

Yes. Several discussion steps remain before rebuilding the Colab notebooks or drafting the report.

## Remaining roadmap

8. Define and verify the OpenAI LLM brain
9. Define technique knowledge, biomechanics and explainability
10. Define memory, database and personalisation
11. Define implementation, security and deployment
12. Plan the literature review
13. Finalise the experiment protocol
14. Collect all evidence and screenshots
15. Rebuild both Colab notebooks
16. Run model and system experiments
17. Approve the final chapter structure
18. Only then begin writing the report

# Step 8: OpenAI LLM brain

## Recommended role

The LLM should operate after situation awareness:

```text
Perception and models
        ↓
Deterministic movement interpretation
        ↓
Situation awareness
        ↓
Structured context packet
        ↓
OpenAI LLM
        ↓
Response validation
        ↓
Voice/text feedback
```

The LLM should be responsible for:

- Explaining corrections naturally
- Selecting suitable language and tone
- Answering user questions
- Summarising structured evidence
- Personalising communication
- Maintaining conversational context

It should not be responsible for:

- Reading raw video
- Calculating joint angles
- Recognising phases independently
- Counting repetitions
- Inventing form errors
- Overriding tracking uncertainty
- Overriding deterministic safety decisions

## Recommended LLM input

Example:

```json
{
  "mode": "train",
  "technique": "selected_technique",
  "motion": {
    "tracking_confidence": 0.91,
    "prediction_confidence": 0.78
  },
  "action": {
    "phase": "execution",
    "step_probability": 0.84,
    "likely_mistake": {
      "body_part": "right_fist",
      "issue": "insufficient_closure"
    }
  },
  "session": {
    "completed_repetitions": 3,
    "consistency_score": 0.67,
    "trend": "stable"
  },
  "situation": {
    "state": "correcting",
    "attention_target": "right_fist",
    "recommended_action": "repeat_step"
  }
}
```

No raw image, video or participant identity should be included.

## Recommended LLM output

Use constrained structured output:

```json
{
  "feedback_type": "correction",
  "message": "Close your right fist before extending the strike.",
  "action": "repeat_step",
  "focus_body_part": "right_fist",
  "evidence_ids": ["right_fist_insufficient_closure"],
  "should_speak": true,
  "should_show_text": true
}
```

The system should validate:

- Is the body part present in the context?
- Is the error supported by measured evidence?
- Does the action match situation awareness?
- Is progression permitted?
- Is the response safe and concise?
- Is the output valid JSON?

Invalid responses should fall back to deterministic template feedback.

## Replaceable brain design

The architecture should use an interface such as:

```text
CognitiveReasoningProvider
    ├── OpenAI provider — current
    ├── Local/domain LLM — future
    └── Template fallback — safety and offline operation
```

This supports your claim that OpenAI can later be replaced without redesigning the full Combat Cognition pipeline.

## LLM evidence required

For the report and evaluation, we need:

- Exact OpenAI model name
- API endpoint or library
- Integration source file
- System prompt
- Prompt/context construction
- Output schema
- Validation logic
- Fallback behaviour
- Example anonymised inputs and outputs
- Response latency
- API-failure behaviour
- Screenshot showing live LLM feedback
- Approximate API cost, if available

Do not provide the API key.

## Current verification issue

The repository I inspected contains the structured coaching-context packet and deterministic coaching agents, but I did not find an OpenAI API call. Therefore, one of these is likely true:

- The integration is in another project version;
- It runs through an external service;
- It has not yet been added to this repository;
- Or the deterministic agent is currently being interpreted as the LLM.

For Step 8, please provide the location of the OpenAI integration or describe how the application currently sends information to OpenAI. If it is not yet integrated, say so; we can classify it as required implementation work rather than incorrectly reporting it as completed.

> yes next

We can continue, but Step 8 remains open until the OpenAI integration is located or implemented.

# Step 9: Technique knowledge, biomechanics and explainability

This step defines how Combat Cognition knows what correct martial-arts movement looks like and how it explains an error.

## 1. Technique knowledge packages

The system uses technique packages containing:

- Technique identity
- Category and difficulty
- Training steps
- Ideal joint angles
- Acceptable angle ranges
- Primary and supporting measurements
- Coaching labels
- Movement states
- Allowed transitions
- Persistent form errors
- Practice and training policies

This makes the framework extensible:

```text
Combat Cognition engine
          +
Technique knowledge package
          =
Technique-specific cognition
```

The cognitive engine remains general; the package supplies technique-specific knowledge.

## 2. Perception-to-explanation chain

```text
Camera frame
      ↓
Body, hand and face landmarks
      ↓
Anatomical-side assignment
      ↓
Body normalisation and calibration
      ↓
Joint-angle calculation
      ↓
Comparison with target ranges
      ↓
Biomechanical error measurement
      ↓
Error persistence confirmation
      ↓
Priority selection
      ↓
Situation awareness
      ↓
LLM explanation
```

This chain is central to the framework’s explainability.

## 3. Joint-angle calculation

For three points \(A\), \(B\) and \(C\), with \(B\) as the joint:

\[
\theta =
\cos^{-1}
\left(
\frac{(A-B)\cdot(C-B)}
{\|A-B\|\|C-B\|}
\right)
\]

This produces joint angles for measurements such as:

- Elbow flexion or extension
- Shoulder position
- Hip angle
- Knee angle
- Ankle alignment
- Wrist alignment
- Stance orientation

The Methodology chapter should include this equation and define every variable.

## 4. Target representation

Each biomechanical target should contain:

- Body part
- Minimum acceptable value
- Maximum acceptable value
- Ideal target angle
- User-facing label
- Role
- Optional importance weight

Example:

```json
{
  "body_part": "elbow_right",
  "min": 165,
  "max": 180,
  "target_angle": 175,
  "label": "Extend the striking arm",
  "role": "primary"
}
```

## 5. Primary and supporting evidence

### Primary targets

Primary evidence may determine whether a movement step is valid.

If required primary data are missing:

> The step should be classified as unscorable or tracking-insufficient—not incorrect.

### Supporting targets

Supporting evidence improves:

- Full-body assessment
- Visual guidance
- Feedback prioritisation
- Situation awareness

Missing supporting evidence should reduce evidence coverage rather than automatically produce a zero score.

## 6. Body calibration

Calibration helps reduce variation caused by:

- Body proportions
- Camera distance
- Limb length
- User positioning
- Perspective

The system stores body ratios, sample count and stability score. The report should explain that calibration supports normalisation but does not create medically precise measurements.

## 7. Anatomical-side handling

Mirrored camera output can create confusion between screen-left and anatomical-left.

The system should distinguish:

- Display side
- MediaPipe side
- Anatomical side
- Lead side
- Rear side

This is particularly important when determining which hand or leg performs a movement.

## 8. Composite form assessment

The form score should combine all valid tracked targets.

It must report both:

- Form score
- Evidence coverage

Example:

```text
Form score: 87%
Evidence coverage: 75%
```

This prevents an apparently high score based on only one visible body part from being presented as a complete full-body assessment.

The report must describe:

- Target-level scoring
- Error distance
- Tolerance
- Difficulty adjustment
- Weighting
- Missing-data handling
- Score aggregation
- Evidence coverage

## 9. Hand and face evidence

The system also evaluates information such as:

- Open or closed hand
- Fist quality
- Hand position
- Face direction
- Eye direction
- Visible facial tension

These should be treated carefully:

- Only score them when tracking is reliable.
- Do not interpret facial expression as a medical or psychological diagnosis.
- Missing optional evidence should not automatically fail the movement.
- Dense face/hand models may reduce performance and can remain selectively enabled.

## 10. Persistent error confirmation

One incorrect frame should not create a correction.

A form error should require:

- Minimum consecutive frames
- Minimum elapsed time
- Sufficient tracking confidence
- Recovery/clear condition
- Cooldown before repeated feedback

This reduces noisy and repetitive corrections.

## 11. Feedback prioritisation

When several errors exist, Combat Cognition should select the most important one according to:

- Safety
- Technique importance
- Primary versus supporting role
- Error magnitude
- Persistence
- Known user weakness
- Current movement phase
- Whether another correction was recently spoken

The LLM then explains the selected evidence. It should not choose an unsupported error.

## 12. Target-pose visualisation

The target skeleton gives a visual representation of the desired shape.

The report should clarify:

> It represents an idealised biomechanical guide constructed from technique targets, not an exact simulation of every valid human body shape.

## 13. Knowledge-source documentation

Every technique parameter needs a source category:

- Published biomechanical literature
- Martial-arts instructional literature
- Researcher’s professional expertise
- Independent instructor review
- Pilot calibration
- Empirical optimisation

If angle ranges were selected by you, report them as:

> Expert-defined prototype parameters developed by the researcher based on professional martial-arts experience.

Do not present expert-defined thresholds as scientifically universal values.

## Step 9 evidence needed

Please confirm later:

1. Did you personally define the technique steps and target angles?
2. Were any books, papers or instructor resources used?
3. Were the ranges reviewed by another martial artist?
4. How were Easy, Medium and Hard tolerances selected?
5. Are all targets equally weighted, or are some more important?
6. Which form errors are considered safety-critical?
7. Do you have screenshots showing correct and incorrect assessments?

Step 9 is acceptable as the proposed explainable knowledge layer. The final report will distinguish expert-defined knowledge from experimentally validated knowledge.

> 1.  yes coz i have 25+ years practice/train/research martial art experience
> 2. my knowledge and biomechanical data
> 3. base on experience/knowledge/biomechanical data
> 4. base on my skill and other Marti artist skills
> 5. it depend on tech?
> 6. ?
> 7. yes i can

> that lot of base on my practice, knowledge, research ,experience ,study difference martial arts, biomechanics, psychology ,philosophy ,...
> so other goal is crate optimize new martial art use biomechanical data(use sensors collect data in future) coz now existing martial arts are energy westing,..

Your 25+ years of martial-arts practice, training and research provide a legitimate domain-expert foundation for the technique knowledge. However, the report must clearly separate:

- Researcher-expert knowledge
- Published biomechanical evidence
- Measurements produced by the current system
- Claims requiring future sensor experiments

## Step 9 decision

### Knowledge origin

Recommended methodology statement:

> The initial technique knowledge base was developed through expert elicitation from the researcher, who possesses more than 25 years of martial-arts practice, training and independent study across martial arts, biomechanics, psychology and philosophy. Technique steps, biomechanical targets, common errors and coaching priorities were formalised into machine-readable technique packages.

If available, the appendix can provide evidence such as:

- Martial-arts qualifications
- Teaching experience
- Styles studied
- Competition or coaching history
- Relevant courses or certificates
- Publications or previous research

This strengthens transparency without claiming that personal experience alone establishes universal scientific truth.

## Biomechanical evidence classification

Every rule should eventually have an evidence label:

| Evidence type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Literature-derived | Supported by a cited paper or book |
| Expert-defined | Based on your professional experience |
| Data-calibrated | Adjusted using participant measurements |
| System-derived | Calculated from MediaPipe observations |
| Future validation | Requires sensors or a larger experiment |

This allows the framework to explain where each piece of knowledge came from.

## Difficulty tolerances

“Based on skill” is acceptable for the initial prototype, but the final methodology should be more precise.

Recommended design:

- Easy: wider acceptable range
- Medium: moderate range
- Hard: narrower range around the ideal value

The initial tolerances may be expert-defined. We should then use pilot data from the three participants to verify whether they are realistic.

Recommended statement:

> Difficulty tolerances were initially established through researcher expertise and subsequently examined using pilot movement data. They represent prototype coaching tolerances rather than universal biomechanical standards.

## Technique-dependent weighting

Yes, importance should depend on the technique.

Recommended rule:

- Equal weighting by default
- Explicit technique-specific weighting when justified
- Primary targets receive movement-validation importance
- Supporting targets affect form quality and feedback
- Missing evidence affects coverage, not automatically accuracy

Every non-equal weight should have a reason, such as:

- Structural importance
- Power transfer
- Balance
- Movement identity
- Protection
- Recovery
- Technical effectiveness

## Safety-critical errors

These are errors that may indicate elevated injury or loss-of-control risk, for example:

- Knee collapsing inward
- Joint hyperextension
- Excessive spinal misalignment
- Unstable balance
- Unsafe landing
- Poor wrist alignment during impact
- Movement continuing under severe tracking uncertainty

However, the current system has not been medically validated. Therefore, use:

> **Potential movement-risk indicator**

Avoid claims such as:

- “The system prevents injury.”
- “The system medically detects unsafe movement.”
- “This angle always causes injury.”

A suitable disclaimer is:

> Combat Cognition provides technique-oriented movement feedback and is not a medical diagnostic or injury-prevention system.

## Screenshots

Your screenshots can support:

- Correct assessment
- Incorrect assessment
- Missing-evidence handling
- Target skeleton
- Primary/supporting targets
- Difficulty changes
- Hand and face assessment
- Prioritised correction
- Tracking-loss response

We will select only screenshots that directly prove a described feature.

# Long-term biomechanical optimisation goal

Your larger goal is valuable:

> To use objective biomechanical and sensor data to design or optimise martial-arts movements for greater mechanical efficiency, reduced unnecessary energy expenditure and improved functional effectiveness.

This should be presented as a **future research direction**, not as a result already achieved.

The current system measures:

- Pose
- Angles
- Kinematics
- Movement timing
- Approximate velocity and acceleration
- Repetition consistency

These measurements cannot directly prove physiological energy expenditure.

## Future sensors required

A future biomechanical optimisation study could include:

- Inertial measurement units
- Force plates
- Pressure insoles
- Electromyography
- Heart-rate monitoring
- Metabolic or oxygen-consumption measurement
- Impact-force sensors
- Motion-capture ground truth
- Balance and centre-of-pressure measurement

## Future optimisation pipeline

```text
Traditional martial-arts techniques

Multi-sensor movement collection
        ↓

        ↓
Multi-objective optimisation
        ↓
Expert and participant validation

```

Possible optimisation objectives would include:

- Reduce unnecessary displacement
- Reduce energy cost
- Maintain or improve impact effectiveness
- Improve balance
- Reduce execution time
- Improve recovery
- Reduce measured joint loading
- Preserve practical applicability

The phrase “existing martial arts waste energy” is too broad for the current report. Use:

> Some traditional movement patterns may contain mechanically inefficient elements under particular conditions; objective sensor-based analysis is required to identify and evaluate them.

## Research positioning

```text
Current research
Combat Cognition Framework
Perception, temporal reasoning, awareness,

Future research

Step 9 is now accepted with this distinction. The sensor-based development of an optimised martial art will be included as a long-term research direction, not as a completed outcome of the present project.

> I’ll carry the component-by-component improvements—perception, temporal reasoning, awareness, LLM, memory and sensors—into the future-work plan. Next we should define the memory and personalisation architecture, because it closes the cognitive loop and determines what the system can genuinely “learn” about a user.

# Step 10: Memory, learning and personalisation

Memory is essential to the Combat Cognition claim because a cognitive system should not treat every frame and session as unrelated.

## Proposed cognitive memory architecture

### 1. Sensory memory

Short-lived raw observations:

- Current pose landmarks
- Hand and face landmarks
- Tracking confidence
- Current timestamp
- Current angle measurements

These exist only long enough to process the current frame.

### 2. Working memory

Short temporal windows used for reasoning:

- Recent landmark frames
- Velocity and acceleration history
- ACP-STGAT input window
- Phase-classification sequence
- Candidate state transitions
- Prediction ledger
- Recent errors and confidence values

This supports immediate motion and action understanding.

### 3. Episodic memory

Records what happened during specific training events:

- Session
- Repetition
- Movement phases
- Accuracy
- Duration
- Errors
- Feedback
- Tracking-loss events
- Session timeline
- Practice tape

This answers:

> What happened during a particular training session?

### 4. Long-term user memory

Aggregated information across sessions:

- Technique history
- Mastery estimate
- Best performance
- Consistency
- Recurring weaknesses
- Learning trend
- Recommended speed
- Coaching intensity
- Progression readiness

This answers:

> What has this user repeatedly demonstrated over time?

### 5. Procedural memory

Knowledge of how movements should be performed:

- Technique packages
- Training steps
- Angle targets
- Movement states
- Transitions
- Error rules
- Coaching priorities
- Model parameters

This represents the framework’s stored martial-arts knowledge.

### 6. Conversational memory

Information required for meaningful interaction:

- Recent user messages
- Pending questions
- Current coaching focus
- Recently delivered feedback
- Current session state
- LLM conversation summary

This prevents repetitive or contextually incorrect dialogue.

## Proposed memory pipeline

```text
Perception
    ↓
Working-memory window
    ↓
Movement and situation interpretation
    ↓
Validated event
    ↓
Session/episodic memory
    ↓
Long-term profile update
    ↓
Relevant memory retrieval
    ↓
Situation awareness and LLM context
```

Only sufficiently validated events should update long-term memory. A noisy frame should not become a permanent user weakness.

## What currently exists

The project already contains:

- Training sessions
- Training-step attempts
- Feedback events
- Practice sessions
- Individual repetitions
- Compressed practice tapes
- Practice analytics
- Body calibration
- Temporal-label drafts
- Backend user-training memory
- Browser-based Level 4 user profile
- Weakness counts
- Mastery and consistency trends

## Important current limitation

Level 4 currently stores part of its profile in browser `localStorage` under a local user identity. The backend separately stores authenticated training memory.

This means the memory system is not yet fully unified:

- Browser memory may be device-specific.
- It may not follow the authenticated user to another computer.
- Browser and backend values may become different.
- Clearing browser storage can remove the Level 4 profile.
- Multiple users on the same browser require careful separation.

The report should describe this honestly unless the systems are unified before submission.

## Personalisation is not model learning

The current system adapts through:

- Exponential moving averages
- Weakness frequency
- Performance trends
- Threshold-based progression
- Recommendation rules

This is **adaptive user modelling**, but it is not continual neural-network learning.

Correct claim:

> Combat Cognition maintains an adaptive user model based on accumulated session evidence.

Avoid:

> The AI automatically retrains itself after every session.

## Recommended unified memory design

Future implementation should use the authenticated user ID:

```text
Authenticated user
      ↓
Backend cognitive profile
      ├── Technique mastery
      ├── Weakness history
      ├── Session summaries
      ├── Calibration
      ├── Coaching preferences
      └── Progression state
             ↓
Small local cache for real-time performance
```

The backend should remain authoritative, while local storage acts only as a cache.

## Memory included in the LLM context

The LLM should receive only relevant summaries:

- Current movement
- Current attention target
- Most frequent relevant weakness
- Recent correction history
- User experience level
- Coaching preference
- Current progression recommendation

It should not receive the entire database or raw session recording.

## Memory evaluation

Test:

- Does a weakness persist across sessions?
- Does the correct user receive the correct memory?
- Does memory survive logout/reload appropriately?
- Can users reset calibration and profile data?
- Do repeated errors increase weakness counts correctly?
- Do corrected behaviours eventually reduce weakness priority?
- Does personalisation agree with expert judgement?
- Does the LLM use retrieved memory correctly?
- Does one user’s data ever appear for another user?

## Privacy and retention

Recommended controls:

- Anonymous participant IDs for research
- Explicit consent for recordings
- Configurable tape retention
- Ability to delete calibration
- Ability to delete session history
- No raw video sent to the LLM
- No API secrets stored in logs
- Minimum necessary context sent externally
- Separate research data from production accounts

## Future memory improvements

- Unified cross-device user profiles
- More reliable mastery calibration
- Confidence-aware memory updates
- Memory decay for outdated weaknesses
- Expert-corrected memory
- Retrieval-augmented LLM knowledge
- Domain-specific martial-arts knowledge base
- Sensor-derived biomechanical history
- Continual learning with human approval
- Federated or privacy-preserving learning
- Comparison of current and historical movement trajectories

## Step 10 conclusion

The report can claim that Combat Cognition contains:

- Sensory memory
- Working temporal memory
- Episodic session memory
- Procedural technique knowledge
- Long-term adaptive user memory
- Limited conversational memory

It should also state that fully unified cross-device memory, continual model learning and sensor-based adaptation are future developments.

> move next

# Step 11: Software implementation, security and deployment

This step explains how the cognitive framework is implemented as an operational system.

## 1. Frontend implementation

Technology:

- React
- Vite
- React Router
- MediaPipe Tasks Vision
- ONNX Runtime Web
- Browser camera and speech capabilities

Responsibilities:

- Camera/video acquisition
- Pose, hand and face perception
- Landmark normalisation
- Biomechanical calculations
- Temporal-model inference
- Skeleton rendering
- Situation-awareness calculation
- Training and Practice interfaces
- Voice/text output
- Local performance adaptation
- Short-term cognitive state

A significant architectural advantage is:

> Raw camera processing and ONNX model inference occur inside the browser.

This can reduce network traffic, improve responsiveness and limit unnecessary transmission of identifiable video.

## 2. Backend implementation

Technology:

- Python
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- PostgreSQL-compatible database
- REST endpoints
- WebSocket communication

Responsibilities:

- User registration and authentication
- Technique-data delivery
- Training-session management
- Practice-session management
- Repetition storage
- Compressed session-tape storage
- Analytics
- Body calibration
- Dashboard data
- Temporal-lab drafts
- Coaching-session state
- Long-term user memory
- LLM integration, once verified

## 3. Real-time communication

The training environment uses a WebSocket for low-latency communication.

Proposed flow:

```text
Browser perception and awareness
        ↓
Structured coaching context
        ↓
Authenticated WebSocket
        ↓
Backend cognitive/LLM service
        ↓
Validated coaching event
        ↓
Browser text and voice feedback
```

The report should explain:

- Connection establishment
- Authentication
- Message schema
- Frame/context update rate
- Reconnection
- Error handling
- Fallback behaviour

The system should send compact cognitive context rather than raw video frames.

## 4. REST communication

REST endpoints support less time-critical operations:

- Authentication
- Technique catalogue
- Training steps
- Practice-session creation
- Repetition saving
- Session completion
- Tape upload/download
- Analytics
- Dashboard
- Calibration
- Administrative temporal drafts

The report does not need to document every endpoint in the main chapter. A concise API table is enough; the complete endpoint list can go in an appendix.

## 5. Database architecture

Main data groups:

### Identity

- Users
- Authentication information
- Role
- Subscription status

### Technique knowledge

- Techniques
- Training steps
- Target angles
- Technique packages

### Training memory

- Training sessions
- Step attempts
- Feedback events
- User-training memory

### Practice memory

- Practice sessions
- Repetitions
- Compressed tapes
- Post-session analytics

### Personalisation

- Body calibration
- Weakness history
- Mastery and consistency
- Session state

### Research administration

- Temporal-lab drafts
- Human annotations
- Model-evaluation metadata

The final report should include an entity-relationship diagram.

## 6. Session-tape compression

Practice frames are stored as compressed JSON using zlib.

Benefits:

- Lower database storage
- Reproducible session replay
- Post-session reprocessing
- Comparison of old and new reasoning algorithms
- Research-data extraction

The methodology should document:

- Frame rate
- Tape schema
- Compression
- Metadata
- Raw versus corrected labels
- Versioning
- Maximum accepted size
- Validation before storage

## 7. Authentication and authorisation

Current controls include:

- Password hashing
- JWT authentication
- Protected frontend routes
- User and administrator roles
- Authenticated REST endpoints
- Authenticated WebSocket sessions
- Password-reset tokens
- CORS restrictions

Administrative capabilities include:

- Uploaded-video testing
- Skeleton laboratory
- Temporal Data Lab
- Model diagnostics
- Advanced data layers

These must remain inaccessible to ordinary users.

## 8. LLM security

The OpenAI API key must:

- Exist only on the backend
- Never appear in browser code
- Never appear in screenshots
- Never be committed to Git
- Never be stored in session tapes
- Never be included in the report

The LLM request should contain only necessary structured context.

Recommended controls:

- Output schema validation
- Prompt versioning
- Timeout
- Rate limiting
- Maximum response length
- Deterministic fallback
- Unsupported-claim rejection
- Response logging without personal data

## 9. Privacy design

Recommended privacy claim:

> Combat Cognition follows a local-first perception architecture in which raw visual input is processed in the browser, while only structured movement and coaching context is transmitted to backend services.

This claim must be verified against the final implementation.

Potentially sensitive information includes:

- Video
- Face and hand landmarks
- Body measurements
- User weaknesses
- Session history
- Conversation logs

The system needs clear consent, retention and deletion policies.

## 10. Performance adaptation

The Studio provides performance modes:

- Quality
- Balanced
- Eco
- Auto

Auto mode measures processing performance and adjusts expensive features.

The report should explain:

- Why adaptive performance is necessary
- Which components are reduced or disabled
- Effect on FPS
- Effect on model update frequency
- Whether accuracy changes

Normal student operation should avoid enabling expensive research layers unnecessarily.

## 11. Error and fallback design

Expected fallbacks:

| Failure | Expected behaviour |
|---|---|
| Camera unavailable | Display clear camera error |
| Tracking confidence low | Pause assessment |
| Hand/face model unavailable | Continue with reduced evidence coverage |
| ONNX model unavailable | Use rule-based reasoning |
| Backend unavailable | Preserve local perception where possible |
| WebSocket disconnects | Reconnect or show offline state |
| LLM unavailable | Use deterministic template feedback |
| Database unavailable | Avoid claiming that results were saved |
| Invalid model output | Reject it and preserve safe state |

Fallback operation is an important part of framework reliability.

## 12. Deployment

The repository contains an Azure deployment design, but production deployment is currently deferred.

Planned separation:

```text
Azure Static Web Apps
Frontend

Azure App Service / container
FastAPI backend

Managed database
Persistent user and session data

OpenAI service
LLM reasoning
```

Until deployment succeeds, describe this as:

> Proposed deployment architecture

Do not describe it as a completed cloud deployment.

## 13. Non-research features

The system also contains:

- Subscription support
- Pricing
- Contact functionality
- Password reset
- User dashboard
- Administrative routes

These demonstrate application completeness but are not the primary research contribution. They should receive a short implementation subsection rather than dominating the thesis.

## Evidence needed later

- Final application route screenshots
- Database schema
- API message examples
- WebSocket context/response example
- Model-loading output
- LLM integration file
- Error/fallback screenshots
- Performance-mode results
- Laptop specifications
- Deployment evidence, if completed
- Security configuration with all secrets removed

## Step 11 conclusion

The implementation can be presented as a browser-first cognitive architecture with:

- Local multimodal perception
- Local temporal-model inference
- Hybrid reasoning
- Real-time backend communication
- Persistent cognitive memory
- Replaceable LLM service
- Role-based research tools
- Planned Azure deployment

Security testing should be described as functional security verification unless a formal penetration test is performed.

# Step 12: Literature review strategy

The literature review should establish why Combat Cognition is needed and how it differs from existing systems. It should not simply describe every technology used.

## Proposed Chapter 2 structure

### 2.1 Martial-artist cognition

Discuss selected cognitive functions:

- Perception
- Attention
- Movement anticipation
- Situation awareness
- Decision-making
- Feedback
- Memory
- Skill adaptation

This section establishes what “cognitive simulation” means within the project’s limited scope.

### 2.2 Computer vision and human-pose estimation

Cover:

- Marker-based versus markerless motion capture
- 2D and 3D pose estimation
- Monocular-camera limitations
- Landmark confidence
- Occlusion
- Fast movement
- Body-proportion and viewpoint differences
- On-device/browser processing

BlazePose GHUM is a useful foundational source because it describes real-time, on-device body and hand landmark estimation from monocular imagery. [BlazePose GHUM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11678)

### 2.3 Biomechanical movement assessment

Cover:

- Joint-angle calculation
- Kinematic variables
- Body-centred normalisation
- Movement range
- Symmetry
- Balance
- Technique-specific thresholds
- Expert knowledge
- Limitations of monocular biomechanics

Clearly distinguish kinematic analysis from force, physiological-energy and injury analysis.

### 2.4 Skeleton-based action recognition

Explain:

- Skeletons as spatial graphs
- Joints as nodes
- Bones as edges
- Temporal connections across frames
- Graph convolutions
- Advantages over isolated-frame classification

The foundational ST-GCN paper directly supports modelling spatial and temporal skeleton patterns. [ST-GCN paper](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/aaai/article/view/12328)

### 2.5 Human-motion prediction

Discuss:

- Short-term pose forecasting
- Spatial joint dependencies
- Temporal dependencies
- Attention mechanisms
- Velocity and acceleration
- Physical consistency
- Prediction-horizon uncertainty
- Noise and occlusion support

Include:

- DDHPose and its diffusion-based 3D-pose approach
- Graph-attention motion prediction
- Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP evaluation
- ACP-STGAT’s relationship to previous work

### 2.6 Temporal phase classification and segmentation

Discuss why movement recognition requires ordered temporal phases rather than a single pose.

Topics:

- Frame-wise phase classification
- Temporal convolution
- Action segmentation
- Boundary recognition
- Over-segmentation
- Duration modelling
- Unknown actions
- Tracking loss

MS-TCN is a useful foundational reference for multi-stage temporal action segmentation. [MS-TCN paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Abu_Farha_MS-TCN_Multi-Stage_Temporal_Convolutional_Network_for_Action_Segmentation_CVPR_2019_paper.html)

### 2.7 Hybrid neural and deterministic reasoning

Compare:

- Rule-only systems
- Learned-model-only systems
- Hybrid systems

Discuss:

- Neural evidence
- Symbolic constraints
- Expert rules
- State machines
- Explainability
- Rejection of impossible transitions
- Safe handling of uncertainty

This section supports the decision to let learned models provide evidence while deterministic logic remains authoritative.

### 2.8 Situation awareness

Use the perception–comprehension–projection concept:

```text
Perception
What is happening?

Comprehension
What does it mean?

Projection
What is likely to happen next?
```

Then relate it to Combat Cognition:

- Perception: landmarks and motion
- Comprehension: action, errors and session state
- Projection: predicted motion, likely error and next action

### 2.9 Cognitive architectures and hierarchical reasoning

Discuss multiple time horizons:

- Frame-level cognition
- Action-level cognition
- Session-level cognition
- User-level cognition

Compare this hierarchy with existing action-recognition systems that stop after classification.

### 2.10 LLM-grounded reasoning

Cover:

- LLMs as language and reasoning interfaces
- Structured grounding
- Hallucination risk
- Constrained output
- Tool/system evidence
- Deterministic validation
- Fallback responses
- Replaceable LLM providers

The review should not claim that an LLM directly understands body movement merely because it receives a text summary.

### 2.11 Memory and personalisation

Discuss:

- Working memory
- Episodic session memory
- User modelling
- Weakness history
- Adaptive feedback
- Skill progression
- Privacy
- Difference between personalisation and continual model training

### 2.12 Martial-arts and sports applications

Review existing work involving:

- Martial-arts pose estimation
- Technique classification
- Exercise correction
- Repetition counting
- Sports coaching
- Rehabilitation feedback
- Martial-arts datasets

MADS is especially relevant because it contains complex Tai Chi and Karate actions with multiview/depth recordings and motion-capture ground truth. [MADS dataset publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026288561730046X)

A public optical motion-capture dataset also contains selected techniques from beginner and advanced Kyokushin Karate athletes. [Kyokushin Karate dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00801-5)

### 2.13 Datasets and evaluation practices

Compare:

- Human3.6M
- MPI-INF-3DHP
- MADS
- Martial-arts motion-capture datasets
- Project-specific recorded data
- Synthetic data

Discuss:

- Participant-separated testing
- Ground-truth quality
- Skeleton-layout conversion
- Domain differences
- Cross-dataset generalisation
- Real versus synthetic evaluation

### 2.14 Literature synthesis and research gap

End the chapter with a comparison table:

| Study | Pose | Temporal | Prediction | Rules | Awareness | LLM | Memory | Real-time |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

The proposed gap is:

> Existing studies commonly address pose estimation, action recognition, movement prediction or corrective feedback as separate problems. There is limited evidence of an integrated martial-arts cognitive architecture connecting perception, prediction, temporal interpretation, biomechanical verification, hierarchical situation awareness, grounded language reasoning and long-term user memory.

We will only finalise this gap after the literature comparison supports it.

## Source-selection rules

Prioritise:

- Peer-reviewed journal papers
- Major conference papers
- Original dataset papers
- Official technical documentation
- Foundational sources
- Recent systematic reviews

Avoid relying on:

- Unverified blogs
- Marketing claims
- AI-generated summaries
- Unsourced websites
- Papers without sufficient methodological detail

## Recommended literature volume

A reasonable target is approximately:

- 35–50 high-quality references
- Foundational older papers where necessary
- Recent work from approximately the last five years
- A smaller number of directly relevant martial-arts sources
- Original sources rather than repeated secondary citations

## Referencing system

The university guideline allows Author–Year or Numeric referencing.

I recommend **Author–Year** because it works well for a discussion-based literature review:

> Yan, Xiong and Lin (2018) introduced...

The same system must be used consistently throughout the report.

## Literature evidence matrix

Before writing Chapter 2, we should build a research matrix containing:

- Citation
- Research problem
- Dataset
- Input modality
- Method
- Temporal capability
- Evaluation metrics
- Results
- Explainability
- Real-time capability
- Limitations
- Relationship to Combat Cognition

This matrix will prevent unsupported research-gap claims.

## Step 12 conclusion

The literature review will support five central arguments:

1. Pose estimation alone is not cognition.
2. Single-frame assessment is insufficient for movement understanding.
3. Learned models need temporal and biomechanical validation.
4. Situation awareness requires multiple time horizons.
5. LLM communication must be grounded in structured, verified evidence.

The next step is to finalise the exact experimental protocol for the three-participant pilot study.

> yes next

# Step 13: Three-participant pilot experiment

This protocol will evaluate the selected technique without making the whole framework technique-specific.

## 1. Study classification

Recommended wording:

> A controlled three-participant pilot study was designed to evaluate the technical feasibility, recognition performance, situation awareness and interactive behaviour of the Combat Cognition Framework.

Because the sample contains only three participants, results will be preliminary.

## 2. Participant information

Record anonymously:

- Participant code: P01, P02 and P03
- Age range
- Gender, if voluntarily provided and relevant
- Height range
- Martial-arts experience
- Experience level
- Relevant physical limitations
- Dominant/lead side
- Previous familiarity with the system

Do not place names in datasets or results.

## 3. Consent

Before recording, provide a short consent form explaining:

- Purpose of the research
- What will be recorded
- Whether raw video is retained
- Whether landmarks are stored
- Whether screenshots may appear in the report
- Who can access the data
- Right to stop or withdraw
- How data will be anonymised

## 4. Test environment

Keep conditions controlled:

- Same laptop
- Same browser
- Same webcam
- Fixed camera resolution
- Fixed camera position
- Marked participant distance
- Similar lighting
- Similar background
- Full body visible where required
- Same system and model versions

Record the laptop, browser, camera and software specifications.

## 5. Preparation

For each participant:

1. Explain the study.
2. Obtain consent.
3. Assign participant code.
4. Record relevant experience.
5. Complete body calibration.
6. Allow a short system familiarisation period.
7. Demonstrate each required test condition.
8. Allow warm-up and rest.

Familiarisation recordings must not be included in final results.

## 6. Recommended movement conditions

Each participant performs:

| Condition | Attempts |
|---|---:|
| Correct, normal speed | 10 |
| Correct, slow speed | 5 |
| Correct, fast speed | 5 |
| Deliberate error type A | 5 |
| Deliberate error type B | 5 |
| Incomplete movement | 5 |
| Unrelated/negative movement | 5 |
| **Total per participant** | **40** |

Total:

> 3 participants × 40 attempts = 120 controlled movement attempts.

Temporary occlusion and tracking-loss events can be introduced during selected attempts instead of creating an additional large condition.

The exact deliberate errors must be defined before testing.

## 7. Condition ordering

Do not perform every correct attempt first and every incorrect attempt last.

Use:

- Randomised or counterbalanced condition order
- Rest between groups
- Consistent instructions
- No correction during ground-truth capture unless the protocol requires it

This reduces fatigue, practice and ordering effects.

## 8. Required recordings

For each attempt, preserve:

- Original video where consent permits
- Practice/session tape
- Frame timestamps
- MediaPipe landmarks
- Model predictions
- Phase probabilities
- Raw and corrected states
- Repetition boundaries
- Form-error output
- Situation-awareness output
- Context packet
- LLM response
- System configuration
- Performance measurements

The original video and system tape should be synchronised using a common start marker or timestamp.

## 9. Expert ground truth

Annotate without viewing the system’s prediction:

- Movement start
- Movement end
- Phase boundaries
- Completed/incomplete status
- Correct/incorrect status
- Form errors
- Expected attention target
- Expected decision
- Appropriate feedback focus

Because you are both researcher and expert:

- Use a predefined rubric.
- Hide system outputs while annotating.
- Randomise recording order.
- Use participant codes.
- Repeat a subset of annotations after at least one week.
- Calculate intra-rater agreement.
- Obtain a second reviewer for a subset if possible.

## 10. System configurations

Replay the same stored movement data through:

### Configuration A — Rule-only

- Biomechanical rules
- State machine
- No learned evidence

### Configuration B — Hybrid

- Motion prediction
- Phase classification
- Biomechanical rules
- Ordered-state validation
- Situation awareness

### Configuration C — Full Combat Cognition

- Hybrid configuration
- User memory
- OpenAI LLM feedback
- Response validation

The phase model will also receive a separate model-only evaluation in Colab. It does not need to control the live system by itself.

## 11. Session-awareness test

In addition to isolated attempts, each participant performs a continuous set.

Recommended:

- Three continuous sets
- Approximately 8–10 repetitions per set
- Normal, slower and faster conditions
- Rest between sets

Evaluate:

- Repetition ledger
- Consistency
- Repeated mistake detection
- Performance trend
- Movement-quality deterioration risk
- Session recommendation
- User-profile update

Do not claim physiological fatigue unless supported by additional measurements.

## 12. LLM experiment

Save structured context packets and compare:

- Deterministic template response
- OpenAI LLM response

Present responses in random order to the evaluator without identifying their source.

Rate each response from 1–5 for:

- Correctness
- Relevance
- Groundedness
- Clarity
- Actionability
- Safety

Also record:

- Unsupported claims
- Contradictions
- Invalid output
- Response latency
- API failures

## 13. User questionnaire

After using the full system, participants rate:

- Ease of use
- Feedback clarity
- Visualisation usefulness
- Voice usefulness
- Responsiveness
- Trust
- Overall satisfaction
- Willingness to use again

Include open questions:

- What was most useful?
- What was confusing?
- Which feedback felt incorrect?
- What should be improved?

With three participants, questionnaire results should be reported descriptively.

## 14. Technical metrics

### Model metrics

- Motion-prediction errors
- Phase precision, recall and F1
- Confusion matrix
- Boundary error

### System metrics

- Repetition precision, recall and F1
- Count MAE
- False repetitions
- Error-detection performance
- Situation-state accuracy
- Attention-target accuracy
- Expert agreement

### Performance metrics

- FPS
- Pose-processing latency
- ACP-STGAT latency
- Phase-model latency
- Awareness latency
- LLM latency
- Total response latency

## 15. Analysis approach

Because there are only three participants:

- Report each participant separately.
- Report combined totals.
- Use mean, median, standard deviation and ranges where appropriate.
- Report confusion matrices and exact counts.
- Avoid strong population-level statistical conclusions.
- Avoid claiming generalisation to all martial artists.

## Step 13 decisions still needed

Before data collection, confirm:

1. Experience level of P01, P02 and P03
2. Exact deliberate error types
3. Whether original video can be recorded
4. Whether another martial artist can review a subset
5. Whether all participants can provide written consent
6. Whether the participants are completely absent from model-training data

After these are settled, the next step is to create the complete evidence and artifact checklist before rebuilding the Colab notebooks.

# Step 14: Evidence and artifact checklist

Before rebuilding notebooks or writing chapters, we should collect and organise all evidence. Original files must be preserved unchanged.

## Recommended evidence structure

```text
research-evidence/
├── 01-project/
├── 02-literature/
├── 03-acp-stgat/
├── 04-phase-classifier/
├── 05-system/
├── 06-llm/
├── 07-pilot-study/
├── 08-results/
├── 09-figures/
└── 10-appendices/
```

We are only agreeing on this structure now. We do not need to create it yet.

## 1. Project documents

Required:

- Approved project title
- Original proposal
- Approved objectives
- University guidelines
- Supervisor feedback
- Submission deadline
- Student and programme details
- Previous presentations
- Existing draft material

## 2. Literature evidence

Collect:

- Paper PDFs
- DOI or publisher links
- BibTeX/RIS citations
- Dataset papers
- Model papers
- MediaPipe sources
- Biomechanical sources
- Situation-awareness sources
- LLM and cognitive-architecture sources

We will maintain a literature matrix rather than relying on memory.

## 3. ACP-STGAT artifacts

Required:

- Original Colab notebook
- Notebook with saved outputs
- Dataset-download cells
- Preprocessing code
- Skeleton-mapping code
- Model architecture
- Training log
- Loss graphs
- Existing metrics
- Hyperparameters
- Checkpoints
- ONNX model
- ONNX metadata
- Example inputs and outputs
- Admin Studio screenshots
- Model-loading logs
- Any failed experiments

Important dataset evidence:

- Exact source URL
- Underlying dataset name
- Licence/usage conditions
- Download date
- Dataset version
- Selected subjects/actions
- Joint structure
- Train/validation/test split

## 4. Phase-classification artifacts

Required:

- Original phase-model notebooks
- Data-preparation scripts
- Human-labelled recordings
- Synthetic recordings
- Label definitions
- Annotation schema
- Class distribution
- Dataset split
- Training logs
- Confusion matrix
- Test report
- PyTorch checkpoint
- ONNX model
- Model metadata
- Browser-inference output
- State-machine configuration

Synthetic and real recordings must remain clearly separated.

## 5. System evidence

Collect:

- Source-code version or Git commit
- Frontend dependency versions
- Backend dependency versions
- API route list
- WebSocket message examples
- Database schema
- Technique-package schema
- Practice-tape schema
- Automated-test output
- Build and lint output
- Model-loading output
- Error/fallback demonstrations
- Performance measurements
- Application screenshots

We already verified 149 automated tests, but final test output should be captured again from the exact evaluated version.

## 6. LLM evidence

Required if the LLM is reported as implemented:

- OpenAI integration source file
- Exact model name
- Model snapshot/version
- System prompt
- Context-packet construction
- Output schema
- Validation logic
- Fallback logic
- Redacted request/response examples
- Latency logs
- API-failure example
- Prompt version
- Temperature and token limits

Never include:

- API key
- Authentication token
- Participant identity
- Raw `.env` file

## 7. Pilot-study evidence

### Private files

- Signed consent forms
- Identifiable original videos
- Participant contact information

These should not be stored in a public repository.

### Anonymised research files

- Participant codes
- Experience level
- Condition manifest
- Session IDs
- Ground-truth annotations
- System predictions
- Phase labels
- Repetition results
- Expert ratings
- LLM ratings
- Questionnaire responses
- Performance logs

## 8. Experiment manifest

Every experiment should record:

```json
{
  "experiment_id": "EXP-001",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "git_commit": "commit-hash",
  "model_version": "version",
  "dataset_version": "version",
  "split_version": "version",
  "random_seed": 42,
  "hardware": "test environment",
  "configuration": "rule-only/model-only/hybrid/full",
  "notes": "purpose and changes"
}
```

This prevents confusion between results from different system versions.

## 9. Results files

Prefer machine-readable results:

- CSV for metric tables
- JSON for experiment metadata
- PNG or SVG for graphs
- Markdown or TXT for concise logs
- Notebook output for reproducibility

Recommended outputs:

- `acp_horizon_metrics.csv`
- `acp_per_joint_metrics.csv`
- `phase_classification_report.csv`
- `phase_confusion_matrix.csv`
- `repetition_results.csv`
- `situation_awareness_results.csv`
- `llm_evaluation.csv`
- `system_latency.csv`
- `participant_summary.csv`

## 10. Screenshot requirements

Each screenshot should have:

- High resolution
- Relevant feature visible
- Consistent interface version
- No API key or token
- No unnecessary personal information
- Participant consent
- Figure description
- Capture date
- System configuration

Maintain a caption register:

| Figure ID | Description | Evidence demonstrated |
|---|---|---|
| F01 | Live perception | Body, hand and face tracking |
| F02 | L1 prediction | Short-term kinematic prediction |
| F03 | ACP overlay | Future-pose prediction |
| F04 | Situation awareness | Attention and decision state |
| F05 | Session analysis | Repetition and performance results |
| F06 | LLM output | Grounded contextual feedback |

## 11. Reproducibility package

The final supporting package should contain:

- Clean executed notebooks
- Environment setup
- Fixed random seeds
- Dataset instructions
- Split manifests
- Evaluation scripts
- Metric outputs
- Model metadata
- ONNX consistency results
- Source-code version
- README with reproduction steps

Large licensed datasets and identifiable videos should not be redistributed.

## Recommended collection order

### Batch A — ACP-STGAT

Upload:

1. Original notebook
2. Output notebook or exported HTML/PDF
3. Metrics
4. Metadata
5. Dataset information

### Batch B — Phase classifier

Upload:

1. Original notebook
2. Dataset preparation
3. Labelled/synthetic data summary
4. Test report
5. Metadata

### Batch C — System and LLM

Upload:

1. LLM integration
2. Screenshots
3. Session tape example
4. Context packet and response
5. Performance output

### Batch D — Pilot study

Collected only after the protocol, consent form and annotation rubric are finalised.

## Step 14 conclusion

No report should be written from screenshots or remembered results alone. Every important claim should connect to:

```text
Source code
    +
Configuration
    +
Dataset
    +
Reproducible output
    +
Interpretation
```

The next step is to inspect the existing ACP-STGAT and phase-classification notebooks, then design their clean replacement notebooks.

# Step 15: Existing notebook assessment

The existing notebooks are useful prototypes, but they are not yet sufficient for defensible thesis results. Rebuilding both research notebooks is necessary.

## ACP-STGAT notebook findings

### Existing implementation

The notebook currently implements:

- 60 past frames
- 30 predicted frames
- 33 landmarks
- Three coordinate channels
- Hip-centred, torso-scale normalisation
- Position, velocity and acceleration features
- Joint-level attention
- Temporal Transformer encoder
- Action-context conditioning
- Constant-acceleration prediction prior
- Future-frame Transformer decoder
- MPJPE training loss
- ONNX export

The deployed ONNX file is approximately 5.6 MB and is successfully loaded by Admin Studio.

### Major evaluation problems

#### 1. Data leakage risk

The notebook creates overlapping windows first and then randomly divides those windows:

```text
Original movement sequence
        ↓
Many overlapping windows
        ↓
Random train/validation split
```

Highly similar windows from the same movement can enter both training and validation. This can produce misleadingly low validation error.

The corrected process must be:

```text
Original participants/sessions
        ↓
Train/validation/test split
        ↓
Create windows separately inside each split
```

#### 2. No independent test set

The existing notebook contains only:

- Training set
- Validation set

There is no genuinely independent final test set.

#### 3. Anatomically unsafe joint conversion

The loader currently adapts non-33-joint skeletons by:

- Selecting evenly spaced joint indices when there are too many joints
- Repeating the last joint when there are too few joints

This does not create a valid MediaPipe anatomical mapping. For example, a 17-joint skeleton cannot become a correct 33-joint skeleton by repeating its final joint.

The new notebook needs explicit mappings for every supported dataset.

#### 4. Graph edges are defined but not used

The notebook defines skeleton edges, but the current attention block performs unrestricted self-attention across all joints. It is not explicitly constrained by the skeleton adjacency graph.

We should either:

- Implement genuine graph-aware attention using MediaPipe edges; or
- Describe the model accurately as a spatial-temporal joint-attention predictor.

Calling it a graph-attention model without using the graph structure could be challenged during examination.

#### 5. “Physics-informed” needs careful wording

The model uses constant-acceleration extrapolation as a prediction prior. This is more accurately described as a:

> **Kinematic prediction prior**

It does not currently model forces, mass, momentum, joint torque or physical contacts. We can retain the ACP-STGAT name, but the report should not imply full physical simulation.

#### 6. Missing evaluation

The current notebook does not provide:

- Test MPJPE
- Per-horizon error
- ADE/FDE
- Per-joint error
- Bone consistency
- Baseline comparisons
- Noise experiments
- Missing-landmark experiments
- Multiple runs
- ONNX/PyTorch parity
- Statistical variation

#### 7. No stored notebook output

The local notebook contains no executed training output. Therefore, the current checkpoint’s training history cannot be independently traced from this file.

## Phase-classification notebook findings

### Strong existing elements

The phase pipeline already includes:

- 90-frame sequences
- 33 landmarks
- x, y, z and visibility
- Hip-centred normalisation
- Spatial graph blocks
- Temporal convolutions
- Weighted cross-entropy
- Session-grouped splitting
- Validation macro F1
- Independent test partition
- Early stopping
- Per-class classification report
- ONNX export
- Synthetic-data provenance
- Human-verification requirement

This notebook has a stronger evaluation foundation than the ACP notebook.

### Remaining problems

- The local notebooks contain no executed outputs.
- The dataset is not stored with the repository.
- The final test report is not stored.
- The number and identities of independent sessions are unavailable.
- Participant separation cannot currently be verified.
- Confusion-matrix output is absent.
- Boundary and repetition-level metrics are absent.
- Model-only, rule-only and hybrid comparison is absent.
- ONNX/PyTorch consistency is not measured.
- Multiple training runs are absent.

### Existing reported results

The deployed phase model metadata reports:

- Validation macro F1: approximately 0.744
- Test macro F1: approximately 0.472

The large reduction suggests weak generalisation, a small test set, distribution differences or class imbalance. We need the dataset and Colab output before identifying the cause.

A separate legacy model reports macro F1 of approximately 0.861, but its metadata explicitly states:

> `evaluation_origin: synthetic_pipeline_check`

That result demonstrates pipeline operation only. It cannot be reported as real-human model accuracy.

## Clean ACP notebook requirements

The replacement notebook will include:

1. Explicit dataset provenance
2. Dataset-specific anatomical joint mapping
3. Mapping validity masks
4. Participant/session split before window generation
5. Independent test set
6. Constant-pose baseline
7. Linear-velocity baseline
8. Constant-acceleration baseline
9. Graph-aware joint processing
10. Training and validation curves
11. Test MPJPE
12. ADE and FDE
13. Per-horizon errors
14. Per-joint errors
15. Bone-length consistency
16. Noise and missing-data testing
17. Multiple random seeds where feasible
18. Inference-time measurement
19. ONNX export
20. PyTorch/ONNX parity test
21. Machine-readable metrics and metadata

## Clean phase notebook requirements

The replacement will include:

1. Real and synthetic provenance
2. Human-annotation validation
3. Participant/session summary
4. Class-distribution analysis
5. Grouped splitting
6. Multiple-run evaluation where feasible
7. Per-phase precision, recall and F1
8. Macro and weighted F1
9. Balanced accuracy
10. Confusion matrix
11. Boundary timing error
12. Repetition-level evaluation
13. Unknown-movement testing
14. Tracking-loss testing
15. Rule-only/model-only/hybrid comparison
16. Failure-case visualisation
17. Inference-time measurement
18. ONNX export
19. PyTorch/ONNX parity
20. Complete test report and metadata

## Evaluation sequence

```text
Correct dataset preparation
        ↓
Leakage-safe model training
        ↓
Independent Colab testing
        ↓
Baseline comparison
        ↓
ONNX consistency testing
        ↓
Admin Studio integration
        ↓
Recorded-tape evaluation
        ↓
Three-participant pilot
```

## Step 15 conclusion

- Both models are implemented as working prototypes.
- The phase notebook has a better split/evaluation design.
- The ACP notebook requires significant dataset and evaluation correction.
- Current screenshots demonstrate integration, not accuracy.
- Current metadata results can be reported only as preliminary results.
- Clean notebooks and fresh experiments are required for the final thesis evidence.
- No existing notebook or model has been changed.

- [Literature matrix](</C:/Users/DELL/OneDrive - Vantage Ltd/Documents/New project/martial-art-ai/research/literature/literature_matrix.template.csv>)

The notebooks include:

- Participant/session-separated train, validation and test sets
- Splitting before overlapping-window generation
- Three repeated training seeds
- Proper model baselines
- ACP-STGAT MPJPE, ADE, FDE, horizon and robustness metrics
- Phase accuracy, balanced accuracy, macro-F1, confusion matrix and boundary metrics
- PyTorch-to-ONNX parity testing
- Median and p95 inference latency
- Dataset, model and output hashes
- Downloadable experiment archives

Both notebooks passed JSON and Python syntax validation: 23 ACP-STGAT cells and 22 phase-classification cells.

They are intentionally not executed yet because real data must be supplied; no accuracy or thesis results were fabricated. No report was generated. The next step is preparing the actual ACP-STGAT and phase-annotation datasets according to the data contracts.

Saved for continuation:

- Renamed task to **Combat Cognition Thesis & Evaluation**
- Pinned the task in Codex
- Created a complete project handoff: [CHAT_HANDOFF.md](</C:/Users/DELL/OneDrive - Vantage Ltd/Documents/New project/martial-art-ai/research/CHAT_HANDOFF.md>)

On your personal laptop:

1. Sign in to Codex with the same account.
2. Open the pinned **Combat Cognition Thesis & Evaluation** task.
3. Allow OneDrive to synchronize the project.
4. If the task is unavailable, open `CHAT_HANDOFF.md` and ask Codex to continue from it.

The handoff contains all decisions, architecture, evaluation plans, model details, limitations, created files, and the exact next steps.

> Yes. I’ll save the new research workspace and handoff in the `martial-art-ai` Git repository, commit only these new research files, then push the current branch to its configured GitHub remote. I’ll leave unrelated files untouched.

Everything is committed locally:

- Commit: `ee5ce25`
- Branch: `main`
- Remote: `https://github.com/SachithBandaraThennakoon/martial-art-ai.git`

The push requires explicit remote confirmation. Please confirm that this is your trusted GitHub repository and you authorize pushing the research files to it.

> no i mean is it good to save inside research folder as markdown then i can import to my lap

Yes, that is a good approach. I already saved the complete working context here:

[CHAT_HANDOFF.md](</C:/Users/DELL/OneDrive - Vantage Ltd/Documents/New project/martial-art-ai/research/CHAT_HANDOFF.md>)

On your personal laptop:

1. Copy/sync or clone the project.
2. Open `research/CHAT_HANDOFF.md`.
3. Tell Codex:
   `Read research/CHAT_HANDOFF.md and continue from the Next work session section.`

The Markdown contains the important decisions and progress—not every message verbatim. No GitHub push occurred; it is saved locally and committed as `ee5ce25`.

> is it save all above chat

No—it saves a detailed handoff summary containing all important decisions, architecture, evaluation plans, and next steps, but not every chat message word-for-word.

If you need the complete conversation preserved, I can also create `research/CHAT_TRANSCRIPT.md` containing the full discussion.

> yes plz save that

> I’ll create a separate transcript file. I’ll preserve the user messages verbatim where available and clearly label any earlier assistant material that can only be reconstructed from the saved task history, so the file does not falsely claim exact wording.

Saved here:

[CHAT_TRANSCRIPT.md](</C:/Users/DELL/OneDrive - Vantage Ltd/Documents/New project/martial-art-ai/research/CHAT_TRANSCRIPT.md>)

It contains 1,033 lines covering the complete discussion sequence, all research decisions, questions, model evaluation plans, architecture and completed work. Long assistant answers are condensed—not falsely presented as word-for-word—but preserve their substance. The handoff file now links to it.

No GitHub push was performed. Both Markdown files can sync through OneDrive or be copied to your personal laptop.

## Continuation saved on 2026-07-31

The discussion continued through ACP-STGAT and temporal phase result reviews,
algorithmic awareness verification, the reasoning/LLM implementation audit and
evaluation package, the full Combat Cognition architecture map, and the expert-
knowledge/reflexive-practitioner methodology.

Authoritative portable status:

- `research/CHAT_HANDOFF.md` — **Current transfer update — 2026-07-31**
- `research/CHAT_TRANSCRIPT.md` — sections 35–42

Next task: create the three-participant end-to-end pilot/framework-evaluation
protocol. Do not generate the thesis yet. Real annotated phase-data retraining is a
later pending item.
