# P001 expert validation of practice-42 clusters

Recorded: 2026-08-01  
Evaluator: P001, researcher/developer/participant and martial-arts expert  
Experience basis: 25+ years of martial-arts practice, training, study, and research

## Expert statement

P001 confirmed that `practice-42` is the latest valid practice session and that
the post-session output shows a good, correct three-repetition cluster. P001 also
confirmed that screenshots 6–14 in the supplied `practice mode` folder were made
by selecting representative clusters/moments in that popup analysis panel.

This is expert practitioner validation within a reflexive single-case study. It is
not independent ground truth because P001 also designed/developed the system and
performed the movements.

The visual timeline contains three completed repetition regions with entry, peak,
exit/hold/recovery or preparation states. The selected screenshots demonstrate
that the stored analysis is navigable frame by frame and that the clustered
sequence is not merely a single summary number.

## Interpretation

The combined evidence supports this bounded finding:

> For the confirmed P001 jab session, post-session temporal clustering identified
> three repetition regions that the researcher-expert judged to be correctly
> clustered, and the interface exposed representative ordered moments for review.

It does not establish a numerical generalization accuracy. The displayed 98.14%
session score is a system-derived form score, while the expert judgement is a
qualitative correctness assessment of the clustering. No independent expert,
second participant, blinded annotation, or rule-only comparison is available.

## Data-layer limitation retained

The correct post-session visual clustering coexists with inconsistent persisted
layers: the canonical summary reports three repetitions, the saved live
rule-engine summary reports zero, and the repetition table contains one row. This
suggests that the post-session decoder successfully repaired/clustered the visual
timeline but its corrected result was not fully propagated to every stored
representation. Both the success and the integration defect must be reported.
